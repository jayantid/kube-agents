"""Every shipped persona reaches the system prompt whole.

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'

Hermes caps each context file it puts in the system prompt (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md) at a
character limit, and keeps only the head and tail of a file over it. The limit is the
profile's `context_file_max_chars` when its config.yaml sets one, and otherwise a share
of the model window that falls to a flat 20,000 whenever the window is unknown or
reported small. The Chat and Platform Agent SOUL.md files are both well past 20,000, so
without a pinned cap the middle of each persona dropped out of the prompt, with nothing
but a log line to show for it.

Two ways that comes back, one check each:

* A profile's config stops pinning the cap, or pins it in a form Hermes ignores. Hermes
  reads only a positive number and silently falls back on anything else, a quoted
  "100000" included.
* A context file outgrows the cap it is pinned to.

The rule itself is not restated here: what Hermes does with the pinned value is checked
against the Hermes the image ships, by the build-time assertion in deploy/docker/Dockerfile
(the platform stage's last RUN). That same RUN also asserts that Hermes auto-titling is
disabled (_auto_title_enabled() is False) for each profile config (#2523). This file is the
half that needs no Hermes, so it runs in CI, where hermes-agent is not installed.
