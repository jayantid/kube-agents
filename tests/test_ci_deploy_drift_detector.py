"""The eval install runs the drift detector, pointed at the pool project's subscription.

Two halves that have to agree, owned by different engines.

The *ingress* is Terraform's. `scripts/provision_ci_pool_project.sh` sets
`enable_drift_pubsub` in the `terraform/examples/full-install` tfvars, and
`terraform/modules/drift-pubsub` creates the Log Router sink, the drift-audit
topic and its pull subscription, and grants the platform GSA subscriber and
viewer on that subscription. The same tfvars sets
`drift_pubsub_topic_publishers`, the pool's one departure from what an install
provisions, so a drift case can put a synthetic audit record on the topic.
Nothing in `hack/ci-deploy.sh` creates any of it —
AGENTS.md's "the install has one engine" rule, and a practical reason beside
it: the presubmit runner identity holds no Pub/Sub role at all
(`docs/ci-pool-projects.md` section 3), so the gcloud version would need the
CI runner granted `roles/pubsub.admin` on every pool project.

The *consumer* is the lease's. `hack/ci-deploy.sh` upgrades the release the
composition installed and replaces its whole value set, the subscription name
included, so the deploy has to restate the name as well as turn the detector
on. That makes the name live in two places at once, and this file pins them
equal: the composition's `drift_pubsub_subscription` default and the deploy's
`EVAL_DRIFT_SUBSCRIPTION`.

A mismatch is the quiet one. The detector starts, the pod reports Ready, it
pulls a subscription that does not exist, and a drift case files no card — a
result that grades as the agent having failed to triage rather than as the
install being wrong.

Both halves fail the same quiet way for a second reason, which is why the
tfvars keys are checked against `variables.tf` rather than only for their
presence in the provisioner: Terraform treats a key in `terraform.tfvars` that
no root variable declares as a *warning*, so a renamed variable applies green
and onboards a project with the ingress and no publisher grant.
