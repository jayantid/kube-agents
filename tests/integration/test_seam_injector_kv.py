"""Seam: the Go event-watcher injector ↔ the Python session KV server.

The two halves of the alert hand-off have only ever been tested against
same-language fakes of each other — Go's `injector_test.go` against an
httptest stub, Python's `test_session_kv_server.py` against a TestClient. The
existing drift scar (`kind_of_object` OR `kindOfObject` accepted server-side)
is what that gap looks like once it has already bitten. This test compiles and
runs the real Go client (`injector_integration_test.go`, env-gated in the
watcher package) against the real server over a real socket.

Skips when no Go toolchain is available, which makes a laptop without `go`
report OK on four tests it never ran -- install one before you believe a green
run here. CI's `test` and `coverage` jobs both set Go up for exactly that
reason, since this tier gates from inside `make test-python`.

    """The toolchain's own build cache when it is usable, a temp dir when not.

    `go test` below compiles the whole operator dependency tree -- controller-runtime
    and client-go -- and whether that is free or expensive is decided entirely by
    which cache it writes into. Measured on this package: 88s into an empty cache,
    3.3s into a warm one. That is not a tuning detail, it is the runtime of this
    file, and through it roughly 40% of `make test-python`.

    So the default is what we want, because in both places that matter it is already
    warm: CI's `test` and `coverage` jobs run actions/setup-go, which restores ~413 MB
    into ~/.cache/go-build before this runs, and a developer's machine has whatever
    they last built. This used to point unconditionally at a fresh temp directory,
    which threw that away and paid the cold compile every run.

    The fallback stays for the case that motivated it -- a HOME that is missing or
    read-only, where the default path cannot be created and `go` would fail rather
    than run slowly. Probing beats assuming: the cheap `go env` read below is what
    tells the two apart, and it is why this is a function and not a constant.

    The probe's answer is not always a path. With HOME unset, `go env GOCACHE`
    prints "off" and exits 0, and taking that at its word both writes a stray
    `off/` directory into whatever the cwd happens to be and hands `go test` a
    disabled cache, which it refuses outright ("build cache is disabled by
    GOCACHE=off, but required as of Go 1.12"). So the sentinel and anything else
    that is not an absolute path go to the fallback.
