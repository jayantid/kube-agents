    The invariant requires every datum to carry a label equal to the meet of
    the labels of everything it was derived from, readable only in a context
    whose label dominates it, with declassification as a named, recorded act.

    Nothing in this codebase carries a label. There is no lattice, no
    declassifier, no owner for the fleet-aggregate decision, and D3 itself is
    listed as needing to be settled before the component evaluation rather than
    after. The nearest thing to a mechanism is the memory partitioning in

    lattice -- and is exactly the confusion the invariant was rewritten to
    remove: two namespaces in one cluster share a scope and may be different

    """D5: BUCKET 3 -- there are no budgets, so there is nothing to exhaust safely.

    The invariant requires per-tenant and per-principal budgets on tokens,
    sessions, tool invocations and triggered work, with exhaustion degrading to
    refusal rather than to a weaker model, a weaker check, a longer cache or a
    permissive fallback.

    Amended 9/16: two budgets now exist on the A2A bus, and neither makes this
    bucket 1. They are recorded here so that "no budget of any kind" does not
    quietly stay written after it stopped being true.

    TASKS is created with max_msgs_per_subject, which bounds one task's own
    event history so a runaway cannot evict every other session's. Created
    with, not converged to: provisioning never edits an existing stream, so an
    install whose stream predates the limit is told about the gap and left to
    apply it, because applying it evicts. It is a budget,
    and crossing it DEGRADES rather than refuses: discard=old evicts the head,
    so a truncated task replays without its `submitted` event. That is the
    behaviour this invariant says exhaustion must not have, so pinning it as a
    D5 control would encode the gap as an intention. What the change does do is
    make the degradation visible -- lib.Task.SubmittedMissing reports it -- and
    that is pinned in the a2a module's own tests, where the fold is.

    TASKS also derives max_consumers from spec.harness.tuning.maxSessions, and
    that one IS a refusal: the provision Job fails at configuration time when
    the live stream cannot hold the configured concurrency, and the server
    refuses the consumer create past the cap. It is still not this invariant.
    The budget is per-install capacity with the operator as its owner, not the
    per-tenant, per-principal budget over tokens, sessions and tool invocations
    that D5 names, and asserting install capacity here would answer a narrower
    question while reading as though it answered this one.

    Otherwise no budget is enforced in this repository, and without one the
    "degrades to refusal" clause has no subject for the surfaces that matter:
    there is no exhaustion event on tokens or tool calls to assert the
    behaviour of. Writing a test that model routing exists and is configured
    would assert a fact about LiteLLM, not the invariant.

    One adjacent property *is* asserted, in test_C_enforcement.py: the read-only
    decision is a pure function of argv, so no model, tier or budget state can
    reach it. That is the "fallback may not lower the enforcement tier" clause
    holding by construction rather than by policy -- which is the strongest
    form of it, and the only part of D5 that is true today.

    What would make this bucket 1: a budget with a named owner and a refusal
    path. Then the assertion is that crossing it produces a refusal and not a
    downgrade.

    The invariant requires a named human role to halt all agent sessions --
    globally, per tenant, per agent, per trigger -- within N seconds, without
    the cooperation of any agent, through a control path sharing no dependency
    with the agent plane, failing closed and surviving restart.

    Three reasons this cannot be tested yet, and they are different kinds of
    missing:

    1. There is no halt mechanism. `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_ENFORCE_READ_ONLY` is the
       only global switch and it points the wrong way -- it *disables*
       enforcement. Nothing stops a session.
    2. N is unset. The requirements document lists it as open, alongside the
       two other unstated Ns in A2 and C2, all three needing owners.
    3. The nearest candidate fails the independence clause by construction: an
       operator cannot flip that variable without editing the Deployment, which
       is the agent plane's own control path.

    It is also the only mechanism that would act faster than GKE's roughly
    one-hour credential cache, which is what makes it the real answer to "cut
    this person off now" rather than a nice-to-have.

    What would make this bucket 1: a halt control with a stated N. Then the
