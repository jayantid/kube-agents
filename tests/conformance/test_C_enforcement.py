        shows the policy, and it selects zero pods. There is no "selected

        exists for: an object's existence mistaken for its enforcement.

        The fence grants DNS, the bus and LiteLLM and nothing else (plus, under
        the operator's cluster-view flag, the credential broker on its one
        port) -- no API-server rule, no 443, no metadata rule beyond DNS -- and that is
        only safe while a session pod holds no credential it could use against
        the API server if it found a route.

        This used to read "names no ServiceAccountName", because the pod had
        none. Per-session bus credentials gave it one: the callout resolves a
        Kubernetes identity, so a session has to present a token, and a token
        has to be minted for a ServiceAccount. What keeps the fence's premise
        true is no longer the absence of an identity but the shape of the only
        credential that identity gets, which is three things at once and needs
        all three:

        - Automount stays off, so the default-audience token -- the one the API
          server accepts -- is never mounted.
        - Every token that is mounted is a projected token naming an audience
          that is not the API server's: the bus, and, under the operator's
          A2A_SESSION_CLUSTER_VIEW flag, the credential broker's session
          audience. The API server refuses both for anything else, so neither
          is a cluster credential even though both are Kubernetes ones; the
          broker token reaches one pod on one port, where TokenReview and the
          broker's role table decide what it may run.
        - The ServiceAccount it is minted for is bound to nothing, so even a
          token that reached the API server would authenticate as a principal
          holding no permissions.

        The third clause is why this lives here rather than in Go: the pod is
        spawned by the gateway (module `a2a`) and the ServiceAccount is
        rendered by the operator (module `k8s-operator`), so no Go test in
        either module can check that the identity one names is the identity the
        other left empty.

        This is the invariant `spec.security.egressPolicy: Allowlist` exists to
        establish, and on this tree it does not hold: the operator-rendered
        platformagent-gateway-netpol allows 169.254.169.254/32 on TCP 80 -- the
        metadata server's own ports -- and 169.254.169.252/32 on 988, selecting
        the same `app: platformagent-gateway` pods that
        platformagent-sandbox-metadata-deny selects.

        Two policies over one Pod union their allow-sets, so opting into the
        allowlist does not subtract what the gateway policy adds.

        The failure is real and the feature does not currently do what its name
        says. Recorded here rather than repaired because #676 was deliberate:
        Workload Identity needs the metadata path, and the sidecar layout puts
        the credential proxy in the Pod that would lose it. Scoping those rules
        to the broker Pod under splitCredentialBrokerPod is the shape of the
        fix, and it is a design change to a live-tested slice, not a test edit.

        Deleting this decorator is the signal that the control works: unittest
        reports the pass as an unexpected success.

        All three metadata addresses, not just the famous one.

        169.254.169.252 and fd20:ce::254 reach the same metadata service on
        GKE. A guard written against 169.254.169.254 alone is a guard against
        one spelling.

        ON A CREDENTIAL PORT, which is the qualifier the invariant is written
        in and this assertion used to drop. `metadataServerAddresses`
        (platformagent_egress_policy.go) says it in as many words -- "on a
        credential port" and not "at all" -- because the DNS rule names
        169.254.169.254 on port 53 deliberately: under Cloud DNS for GKE that
        host is the resolver in every Pod's resolv.conf, and 53 reaches no
        token.

        Dropping the qualifier cost more than precision, because this test is
        an expected failure and a failing subTest abandons the method. The DNS
        rule is the FIRST metadata match in the fixture, so it was the recorded
        verdict and #676's rules -- the actual violation, on 80 and 988 -- were
        never evaluated. Worse, the closure route this docstring promises was
        unreachable: scope #676's rules to the broker Pod and the test would
        STILL be red on the DNS rule, so the decorator could never come off and
        the unexpected success could never fire. A permanent expected failure
        is the thing the register exists to prevent.

        A2A_BUS_TOKEN_FILE is not rendered by the operator and never has been:
        the client falls back to lib.BusTokenPath, which is where the kubelet
        projects the token, and the test above is what holds that path to the
        operator's. What the operator does with this name instead is REFUSE
        it -- SensitiveEnvVars for a spec.deployment.env entry, and
        buildPodTemplateSpec's own drop for an AgentPlugin's spec.env, which
        is one layer further out than the webhook looks.

        So the failure a drift produces here is not a client that cannot
        connect. It is a reservation over a name nothing reads: the operator
        goes on refusing A2A_BUS_TOKEN_FILE while the client consults
        A2A_BUS_TOKEN_PATH, and an AgentPlugin -- model-authored content
        reaches the container this variable belongs to -- sets the name that
        is actually read. a2a/cmd/a2a/main.go's connect() prefers an
        explicitly set value over the projection with NO fallback, so the
        container then presents whatever file the plugin named. The blast
        radius is denial rather than escalation, because every other token in
        reach is minted for somebody else's audience and the bus refuses it at
        connect -- but a control that can be silently pointed at the wrong
        name is not a control, and the reason it is a security assertion is
        that nothing fails: the operator's own tests stay green on both sides
        of the drift, because no test binary links both modules.

        Read as source for the same reason its two siblings are. The Go
        constant in the operator is the one the comparison is about, so the

        the CLI's blackboard reads and the bridge's task-plane execution were
        one grant set. Retiring it split the credential in two, and the agent
