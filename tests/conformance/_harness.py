"""Shared plumbing for the conformance suite.

Two things live here and nothing else: how to reach a source artifact, and how
to record an invariant the product does not currently satisfy.

## Why there is a source registry rather than open() calls in the tests

A conformance test that reads a file which has moved does not fail -- it
raises, and if it raises inside an expected-failure it is counted as a pass.
That is the failure mode this suite exists to prevent, so every artifact a test
reads is declared in SOURCES with at least one anchor string, and
test_harness_selfcheck.py asserts each path exists and each anchor is present.
Rename a file or a symbol and the self-check goes red before any invariant test
gets a chance to go quietly green.

The question to ask of this file, and the one the slice-2b review says should
be in every reviewer prompt by default, is "could the harness itself be the
thing that passes?"  The self-check module is the answer, and it is only an
answer for as long as every new test registers what it reads.
