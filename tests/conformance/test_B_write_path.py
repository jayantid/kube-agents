"""Group B -- The write path.

B1  No agent principal holds a credential that can cause a production change.
B2  Assent is human or policy. Agents get veto only.
B3  The enforcement substrate is not agent-authorable.
B4  The executor is a governed principal.
B5  What the approver sees is what will be applied.
B6  No self-approval, and no agent satisfies a required review.

Agents are read-only against clusters and propose changes as pull requests, so
the ceiling this group tests is a ceiling on `kubectl` -- not a ceiling on
impact. An invariant set that only governs API calls governs the wrong API,
which is why most of what follows reads workflows and manifests rather than
argv.
