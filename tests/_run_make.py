"""Run `make` from a test, the way a developer runs it by hand.

A test module that drives `make` may itself be running inside the
`make test-python` sweep, and an inherited jobserver or MAKELEVEL would make
the nested make behave unlike the one a developer runs. Scrubbing those is one
piece of knowledge, kept here so a further variable to drop or a change of
policy is fixed once rather than in each module that happens to import it. Not
a test module itself: `test_*.py` is the discovery pattern.

    Defaults to the repository root, which is what the callers driving the root
    Makefile want. `cwd` covers the nested Makefiles -- k8s-operator/ is the
    only one today -- so a test driving one of those gets the same scrubbing
    rather than reimplementing it.

    `extra_env` is for the process environment, which is not the same thing as
    a `VAR=value` argument: a test that shadows a binary on PATH has to reach
    the environment, and doing that by hand means rebuilding the scrubbing
    above at the call site.

    `drop_env` names variables to remove from the environment before make
    runs. A `?=` default yields to an exported variable, so a test that wants
    to observe the Makefile's own default has to make sure the developer's
    shell is not supplying one; `extra_env` can only add.
