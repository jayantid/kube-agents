"""The drift subscription's name reaches both of its consumers, and the copies agree.

full-install composes the drift-pubsub module behind `enable_drift_pubsub` and
lets a caller rename the trio it creates (`drift_pubsub_topic`,
`drift_pubsub_subscription`, `drift_pubsub_sink`). Two things have to hold for
the rename to be safe, and each is asserted against source rather than against
another document:

  - one subscription name reaches both consumers: the module's
    `subscription_name` (what gets created) and the chart's
    `platformAgent.harness.driftDetector.subscription` (what the detector
    pulls from). The detector's compiled-in default is the module's default
    name, so an install that renames the subscription and does not carry the
    rename into the CR has a detector that pulls a subscription that does not
    exist. Nothing fails closed on that: the detector never exits, it retries
    the pull for the life of the pod, the entrypoint's short-exit ALERT cannot
    fire, and the pod stays Ready (the package comment on
    k8s-operator/cmd/drift-detector/main.go says so), which is what makes the
    failure silent.
  - the chart block is written only when the module exists. The chart renders
    a `driftDetector` block into the CR as soon as one field is set, and the
    CR template says an install that never asked for drift detection should
    not carry one. The same block carries `enabled` from
    `enable_drift_detector`, and a precondition refuses the other order. What
    that precondition prevents is quieter than the silent failure above:
    because the block is written only when the ingress is on, an
    `enable_drift_detector` set without `enable_drift_pubsub` renders no
    `driftDetector` block at all, so the apply succeeds, provisions nothing,
    starts nothing, and leaves a variable that did nothing as the only
    evidence. The precondition tests `local.drift_detector_requested` rather
    than the flag, because `extra_helm_values` reaches the same leaf: Helm
    deep-merges it over the computed document, so a caller can turn the
    detector on there and land the first failure above instead of this one.
  - the composition's three defaults equal the module's, and the detector's
    `defaultSubscriptionName` equals the subscription's, so an install that
    never sets a name gets the resource the detector looks for. docs/README.md
    names this file as what holds those copies together.

Terraform is not a dependency of this suite; the HCL is read as text.

        `tobool` fails on "yes" and on 1, and the `try` catches both. It does
        not fail on null: the conversion succeeds and returns a null of type
        bool, so the `try` has nothing to catch and the null reaches `||`,
        whose arguments may not be null. The plan aborts on the local, naming
        no variable, for every apply that passes the leaf that way — including
        `enable_drift_detector = true`, since OpenTofu evaluates both operands.

        That input is not a typo, which is what makes it worth a test rather
        than a comment: the chart ships the leaf as null and its schema types
        it that way, because null is how a knob is omitted so the CRD's own
        default applies. An operator copying the `driftDetector` block into
        `extra_helm_values` to set `gitopsManagers`, which the composition
        does not expose, writes exactly that. Asserted against the chart
        rather than restated, so that a chart that stopped teaching null would
        take the reasoning with it instead of leaving it stale here.
