"""Tests for the wiring in .github/workflows/release-publish.yml.

The gate that decides whether an unattended run releases lives in shell scripts
with their own suites. What this file covers is the YAML connecting those
scripts' verdict to the publishing job, because that connection is where the
gate can be removed without any other test going red.

Three expressions carry it, and each fails quietly if it is dropped:

  - `needs.evaluate-schedule.outputs.should_release == 'true'` on the publish
    job. Lose it and every scheduled run publishes.
  - the `outputs:` mapping on the gate job. Lose it and `should_release` reads
    as empty, which is falsy, so nothing ever publishes — the harmless
    direction, but still silent.
  - the `TARGET_COMMIT` fallback to the gate's `release_commit`. Lose it and a
    scheduled run still publishes, just from whatever calculate_next_version.sh
    auto-resolves on its own. The two read the same tag family, so nothing would
    look wrong — until a candidate is promoted between the gate job and the
    publish job, and the release goes out at a commit nothing gated.

The cron trigger is decoupled: release-publish.yml is strictly dispatch-only so that quiet
ticks with nothing to release produce no workflow run at all. The weekly cron ("17 6 * * 5")
lives on .github/workflows/release-scheduler.yml, which evaluates candidate eligibility
and dispatches release-publish.yml only when work is required.
