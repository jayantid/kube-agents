"""Invariants of the staging promotion pipeline that only the workflow YAML can carry.

Most of these are failures that would be silent in CI — a green run that did the
wrong thing — which is why they are pinned here rather than left to review:

  * a job pointed at `rc` instead of `nightly` tears down the RC environment,
  * a teardown that `needs` the nomination, the eval wait or the promotion is
    skipped when any of them fails, leaving a GKE cluster billing with nothing on
    it to diagnose — and, for the eval wait, held for the five and a half hours
    the poller is allowed even when everything succeeds,
  * a hardcoded `rc-environment` concurrency group makes an unrelated workflow
    contend for the release pipeline's cluster,
  * a staging tag shape the redeploy trigger does not match promotes nothing and
    still reports success,
  * a staging tag that does not `needs` the eval wait promotes a candidate whose
    eval is still running or already red, which is the whole gate gone,
  * a promotion carrying step 4's GitHub App token rather than minting its own
    pushes with a credential that expired hours into the wait,
  * a redeploy that deploys the pushed ref's SHA rather than the commit it peels
    to pulls an image tag nothing ever published,
  * an optional-suite order that runs `gchat` after `agent-plugin` sends the chat
    prompt at a gateway the 17-step plugin suite is still rolling.

Three of them are the gate itself, and they are pinned against the specific
edits that would turn it off while leaving every other test green — which is
what makes them worth their own tests rather than a line in review:

  * a status function anywhere in step 6's `if` (`always()`, `!cancelled()`,
    `success() || …`) restores the promotion on a red eval,
  * `continue-on-error: true` on the poller step makes step 5 succeed whatever
    the verdict was, and step 6's implicit success() then passes,
  * dropping the `settled` clause from step 5b's `if` withdraws the nomination on
    a red verdict too, which re-measures every rejected candidate nightly at
    hours of a shared project each time.
