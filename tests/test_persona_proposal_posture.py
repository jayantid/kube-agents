"""The platform persona proposes in the reply unless asked to submit.

Under the A2A bridge the platform persona is the front door: it reads the user's
request itself, with the full CLI bundle, and there is no kanban card scoping
what it does. Asked to investigate a crashlooping workload and report the root
cause, it diagnosed correctly and then opened a GitOps pull request nobody had
asked for, on three periodic runs in a row (gke-labs/kube-agents#2037). It was
following its own instructions: "propose the fix through the active declarative
workflow" and "do not wait to be asked" read, at the front door, as "open a PR".

The rule that stops it lives in the persona and in the skill that opens the pull
request, and it reaches a running install only through the agent image. Nothing
executes the prose, so these tests pin the phrases the rule is made of: a
rewording that keeps the rule keeps them; one that drops the rule fails here
before it fails a periodic run a day later.

Run:
  python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_persona_proposal_posture.py' -v
