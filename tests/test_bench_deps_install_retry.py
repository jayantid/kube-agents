"""`make test-bench-deps` retries the pip install a bounded number of times.

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'

Stdlib unittest, no pytest, matching the other suites in this directory.

The bench harness pins devops-bench to a git SHA, so a fresh runner clones it
from github.com inside `pip install -e bench/`. pip retries its HTTP downloads
but not that clone, and one GitHub-side 504 on it failed a pull request's
bench job outright while a re-run of the same tree passed. The recipe now
retries the whole install, three attempts a few seconds apart, and still fails
after the last.

Nothing about that loop is visible in a normal run: the first attempt almost
always succeeds, and a mutant with the `sleep` or the ceiling deleted reports
green until the next bad minute. So the loop is *run*, not read: these tests
point the recipe at a stub `pip` through `BENCH_PIP` and count invocations,
the pattern `test_third_party_download_retry.py` uses for the envtest fetch.
The two defaults the loop runs with are read back from make's own variable
database, because the behaviour tests override the delay to keep the suite
fast and so cannot see a default pause that went to zero.
