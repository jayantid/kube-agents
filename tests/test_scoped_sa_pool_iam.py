"""What the scoped service account pool grants, and what it must not.

The pool exists because impersonation constrains only the RBAC half of GKE's
IAM-or-RBAC union: an identity holding `roles/container.viewer` reads objects in
every cluster in the project no matter how narrow its Kubernetes RBAC is. One
account per project in scope was meant to move that read authority off the
agent's own identity and onto something narrower than the fleet.

As of 2026-08-12 it does not. The IAM Condition each member was scoped by grants
nothing for Kubernetes object operations, and the un-conditioned binding is
project-wide `container.viewer`, so both were removed. A member is a principal
with no authority at all, and the pool is off by default.

That leaves the increment in a state with two halves that must move together,
which is what most of this file is about. The Terraform is read as text --
`terraform` is not a dependency of this suite -- but it is read structurally, so
a grant re-added under any name fails rather than a string sweep passing.

  python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_scoped_sa_pool_iam.py' -v
