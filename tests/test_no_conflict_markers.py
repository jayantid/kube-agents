"""No tracked file carries an unresolved merge-conflict marker.

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'

Stdlib unittest, no pytest, matching the other suites in this directory.

A botched rebase resolution reached INSTALL.md: the conflict markers and both
halves of the conflict were committed, so the published install guide told a
reader that re-runs rebuild `k8s-operator/scripts/vars.sh` and, seven lines
below, that they load `install.env`. Nothing in the suite noticed. `make
docs-check` passes over conflict markers — it checks generated regions, links
and that a reader reaches every document, terminology, and the context budget,
none of which look at the line. The only thing that caught it was CI's prettier job, which reformats the
stray `=======` rather than naming it, and which does not run on `.sh`, `.py`
or `.go` at all.

The marker prefixes are matched at a line start and followed by a space or a
line end, which is what git writes. That keeps a Markdown `-------` table rule
and a Python `====` banner comment out of it, and keeps this file's own
docstring from matching itself.
