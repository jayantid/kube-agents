Rewrite an image repository onto a registry prefix, keeping only the trailing

scripts/mirror_images.sh writes and what the operator assumes when it derives

The trailing segment is a stand-in for the real rule. mirror_images.sh names

images.json at render time, so this reproduces it by convention rather than by

kube-agents.thirdPartyImage below takes the real name explicitly. Check 3c in

Fails the render when the LiteLLM OTLP exporter points at an external host that
litellm-policy cannot reach, whoever renders that policy.

Neither copy of the policy has a rule for an external host except port 443, and with no
collector namespace configured the operator emits no OTLP rule at all for an endpoint
that is not an in-cluster Service. So an external endpoint on any other port (an OTLP
vendor's 4317/4318 ingress, say) renders green and exports nothing, and the only signal
is an operator log line. This catches it at render time. Renders nothing; it is
included unconditionally and acts only when litellm.otel is on — the check is about
LiteLLM's exporter, which does not exist otherwise — and litellm.networkPolicy is on,
since with it off nothing blocks. An explicit telemetry.collectorNamespace is the user
asserting the collector is in-cluster whatever its host looks like (an IP literal, a
bare Service name), and both renders then open 4317/4318 to that namespace, so the
check stands aside for it. It also stands aside for an in-cluster host on a port other
than 4317/4318, on purpose: the URL carries the Service port and the policy sees the
targetPort, so a Service mapping 9999 to 4318 works and a fail there would be wrong.

Two host shapes are refused even on 443, because the 443 rule excepts private ranges
and they are decidable at render time: an IP literal inside a range that render's 443
rule excepts, and a single-label hostname, which resolves through the Pod's search
domain to a Service in its own namespace. Both are in-cluster collectors in disguise,
and telemetry.collectorNamespace is the remedy, as it was before this check existed.
The two rules except different ranges — the static copy the three RFC 1918 blocks and
nothing over IPv6, the operator's those plus CGNAT and link-local space, and over IPv6
unique-local, link-local and multicast — so the check refuses exactly what the rule it
is standing in for does not reach, and nothing else: a loopback literal is excepted by
neither and renders. A DNS name that happens to resolve to private space is not
decidable here, and the docs say so.

topologySpreadConstraints for a multi-replica workload this chart owns.

Renders nothing below two replicas, so the operator gets the field only if
someone raises operator.replicaCount. A constraint over a single pod is
satisfied by construction, and printing it would leave a reader working out that
it means nothing. Hindsight has no call site at all for the same reason taken
further: both its workloads carry a literal `replicas: 1` with no value behind
it, so a call there could never render and would read as coverage it does not
have.

The chart shipped PDBs and a default replicaCount of 2 for litellm and
github-token-minter without this, and the Workload Reliability Audit in this
repository found both on 2026-09-06: "replicas=2, no topologySpreadConstraints
or podAntiAffinity". The PDB does not cover the gap it names. maxUnavailable: 1
stalls a *drain* that would take both replicas, but a node that fails takes
whatever is on it, and nothing was keeping the two pods apart.

ScheduleAnyway, not DoNotSchedule — obtainability_audit_sop.md 3.8 calls that
mandatory, and the reason is the shape of the clusters this chart installs into.
A pool that cannot satisfy maxSkew: 1 leaves the second replica Pending
indefinitely, which is worse than the co-location this exists to avoid.

kubernetes.io/hostname and not the zone key, for the same section's reason: the
loss this guards against is a node going away under a drain or a repair, and a
zonal cluster has one zone to spread across.

The selector is the workload's own and is passed in rather than derived, as
already-rendered YAML rather than a dict so the operator can hand over
`kube-agents.operatorSelectorLabels` verbatim instead of a second copy of it. A
labelSelector that does not match the pods the constraint is attached to counts
some other population and skews against it; these selectors are also immutable
once the Deployment exists, so the caller is the only thing that knows the right
answer. Keep each call in step with its Deployment's spec.selector, the way
pdb.yaml's selectors already have to be.

matchLabelKeys scopes the skew to one ReplicaSet. Without it the constraint
counts old and new pods together during a rollout, and with maxSurge: 1,
maxUnavailable: 1 and two nodes holding one replica each, the surge pod lands
beside an old one, the controller prefers to delete the old pod that shares a
node, and the second new pod then sees a tie and can land on the same node —
both live replicas on one node until the next rollout, which the constraint
exists to prevent. Every image pin, config checksum or resource change is a
rollout, so this is ordinary use. pod-template-hash is the label the
Deployment controller stamps per revision; the field is on by default from
Kubernetes 1.27, inside the chart's 1.29 floor.

The providers of the forges the install declares, comma-separated and
deduplicated, folding the deprecated `integration.github` alias in as one
`github` forge. Two spellings of one setting is how a values file ends up
declaring one forge and provisioning another's credentials, so nothing reads
the forge values directly to decide which forge this is -- everything calls
this, and the minter guard is the reason it has to be one answer.

It also carries the checks the chart can make before the API server does, so
the failure names the values key: the two spellings are exclusive, forge names
are unique, a provider must be registered, a GitHub forge's host must be one GitHub serves and its
namespace a GitHub organisation or user name, and a repository must name a
declared forge, be neither empty nor the alias's `None`, and be qualified by a
namespace if it is a bare name; and at most one repository has role gitops. The namespace checks matter beyond the error
text: a single-forge declaration renders as the alias, so without them the
refusal would name `github.org` or `github.gitRepo`, keys the values file never
set.

Renders the empty string when no forge is declared at all, which is a valid
install: repositories can be registered in the gitops-state ConfigMap later.
`gitRepo: None` is the alias's sentinel for "no repository", so on its own it
declares nothing -- reading it as a declaration would make it collide with the
`forges` list that replaces it, which is the migration every install has to
make.

{{/*
Validates and resolves a Deployment's rollingUpdate fenceposts, returning a
YAML map with `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable`. Callers parse the output with
`| fromYaml`.

Both fenceposts at zero leaves the Deployment no way to make progress and
the API server rejects it ("may not be 0 when maxSurge is 0"), so fail
the render rather than the apply. See values.yaml's rollingUpdate blocks.

A fencepost with no usable value takes the given default (defaultSurge,
defaultUnavailable) and renders explicitly. "No usable value" has to mean
the empty string as well as nil/invalid: `--set <scope>.maxUnavailable=` and
a values file's `maxUnavailable: ""` both reach here as an empty string,
which is a perfectly good `kind` and so survives a nil test. Rendering
either through would emit `maxUnavailable:` with nothing after it, and
Kubernetes then applies its own 25% default.

Both fields are IntOrString, which is what makes the zero test awkward:
`int` is cast.ToInt and reads "25%" as 0, so it would refuse a pair of
perfectly good percentages, while a list of literal spellings misses
"0.0". Compare numerically with the percent sign stripped — "0%"
resolves to 0 on the cluster, so it is the same misconfiguration spelled
differently. `float64` is cast.ToFloat64, which reports anything it
cannot parse as 0, so the numeric test is gated on both values actually
being numeric: without that, `maxSurge: abc` is refused as a zero and
the message names the wrong problem. Non-numeric input is left to the
API server, which is where it was rejected before this guard existed.

Resource parsing helpers for quota preflight (#749).
Converts Kubernetes quantities to canonical integer units:
- CPU: millicores (e.g. "500m" -> 500, "1" -> 1000, "1.5" -> 1500, "1500u" -> 2)
- Memory / Storage: bytes (e.g. "128Mi" -> 134217728, "2Gi" -> 2147483648)

Both fail the render on a quantity they cannot parse rather than returning a number.
An earlier version fell through to `int64`, which yields 0 for anything it does not
understand: a `1Pi` quota then read as `hard 0` and the release was refused with a
message describing a cluster that does not exist. A quantity this cannot read is a bug
in this helper, and saying so is the only honest outcome.

Every conversion to an integer goes through kube-agents.clampInt64 rather than `int64`,
because the millicore and byte forms of a large quantity overflow where the quantity
itself does not. `1E` CPU is 10^21 millicores and `8Ei` is 2^63 bytes, both past
math.MaxInt64, and Go's float-to-int conversion wraps them to -9223372036854775808:
`hard` then read as negative, fell short of every requirement it dwarfs, and the render
was refused with a patch asking for a negative quota. Saturating keeps the comparison
honest — a quota that large cannot constrain this release either way.

Reads one resources block — requests and limits, CPU, memory and ephemeral-storage — from a
values subtree, and returns the parsed quantities as JSON.

Every field is optional at every level. values.schema.json declares each `resources` as a
bare object with no `required` keyword, so `--set litellm.resources.limits=null` — the
documented Helm way to drop a key, and the obvious edit for someone who does not want
limits charged against a quota — is valid input. Reaching through it with
`.Values.litellm.resources.limits.cpu` aborted the whole render with `nil pointer
evaluating interface {}.cpu`, and only in a namespace that has a ResourceQuota, which is
the one population this check exists for.

When requests are omitted but limits are specified, Kubernetes defaults the request to
match the limit at admission time, which is reflected here. When a quantity is omitted
from both requests and limits, it contributes zero to the sum (though note that if a
ResourceQuota constrains that resource, Kubernetes quota admission requires containers

"Omitted" is decided by kube-agents.declaredQuantity rather than by Sprig's `default`,
for the same reason kube-agents.replicaCount exists: `default` calls 0 empty, and each
`resources` block is an open object in values.schema.json, so `requests: {cpu: 0}` is
valid input that arrives as a numeric zero. Chained through `default` it read as absent
and was charged the limit instead — a workload asking for nothing was summed as the
largest thing it could ever use.

{{/*
Preflight validation against namespace ResourceQuotas (#749).

Split into three templates so the parts that need no cluster can be tested without one:

- kube-agents.quotaRequirements — totals what the release needs, as JSON. Pure function of
  the values and footprint.yaml.
- kube-agents.quotaCheckItems — compares those totals against a list of ResourceQuota
  objects and fails the render on a shortfall. Takes the list as an argument.
- kube-agents.quotaPreflight — the entry point: looks the quotas up, then calls the two above.

Only the last one touches the cluster, so tests/test_quota_preflight.py can drive the other
two with synthetic quotas and assert the arithmetic and the pass/fail decision offline.

Fails the render if:
- hard < required (the quota cannot fit the release even if empty)
- OR (hard - used) < required AND .Release.IsInstall (on a fresh install, remaining headroom
  is insufficient). Install-only on purpose: on upgrade the release's own pods are already
  counted in `used`, so subtracting them again would refuse every upgrade of a release that
  exactly fits its quota. The cost of that exemption is that `used` on upgrade also holds
  any neighbouring workload's usage, which this cannot tell apart from the release's own —
  so in a namespace shared with other workloads an upgrade is checked against `hard` alone.

Quota keys understood: CPU, memory and ephemeral-storage (requests and limits), pods,
persistentvolumeclaims and requests.storage. Keys outside that set (services, secrets, other
count/<resource>) are not modelled, and are skipped rather than guessed at.

Inert when lookup returns empty — `helm template` without a cluster, or a namespace with no
ResourceQuota at all.

It is NOT inert when the installing identity cannot read ResourceQuotas. Helm's `lookup`
swallows a NotFound and returns nothing; every other API error, a 403 on
`list resourcequotas` among them, comes back as a template error and aborts the render. So
the check needs `get`/`list` on `resourcequotas` in the release namespace, and an identity
without it installs with `--set quotaPreflight.enabled=false`. Nothing here can soften that:
a Go template cannot catch the error `lookup` raises.
