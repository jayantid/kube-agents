"""Leave ONE leased project's GitOps repository with no agent pull request open
and no branch but the default.

A remediation case opens a pull request in the leased project's GitOps
repository (`gke-agentic/<project>-infra`) and nothing closes it before the
next lease or the next repetition. The next run's agent finds it and builds on
it instead of investigating: `submit_suggestion.py` adds to its own open
proposal on the same branch, and the fleet audit skips a finding whose pull
request already exists. The pool sweep (hack/ci_sweep_agent_pulls.py) only
visits free projects, so it cannot help inside a job, and a project re-leased
inside its interval carries the leftovers in (#2260).

hack/ci-eval-pr.sh runs this twice: once when the lease begins, before any
unit, and once before every unit of a case that requests a pull request, under
that case's task lock, in the phase where no other unit writes. It then reads
the repository back and refuses to launch the unit unless the repository is
clean, which is the guarantee: every repetition starts as the first did.

What goes, and what stays:

* every open pull request authored by a `[bot]` login from a branch in the
  repository itself. Not by branch name: the agent names its own branches
  when it pushes with git from its sandbox, and most leftovers carry no
  `platform-agent/` prefix. A human's pull request stays open, and so does
  its branch.
* a pull request carrying `audit:remediation` is labelled `audit:stale-closed`
  before it is closed. The fleet audit reads an unlabelled close as a human's
  refusal and never re-proposes that fix in that repository (#2228); a label
  that will not stick leaves the pull request open for the next attempt.
* every branch but the default, whatever its name, unless an open pull request
  that stays still has it as head. A pool repository is a fixture nothing else
  keeps branches in.

Never any repository but the leased project's: `expected_repo` refuses a pair
that does not match, and the token the caller minted is narrowed to that one
repository as well. The token arrives in the environment
(`AGENT_PULLS_RESET_TOKEN`), never on argv. `--record` writes what happened as
JSON beside the job's artifacts, so every run carries its own proof;
`--dry-run` lists and writes nothing, for a laptop with a personal token.
