# Eval dashboard periodic refresh (the periodic job's entrypoint)
# ==============================================================================
# collect -> render -> publish for the live eval dashboard, INCREMENTALLY:
# download the currently published data.json, hand it to collect.py's
# --merge-with so the GCS scan only reads builds newer than the newest one on
# record, then re-render and republish. A cold sweep is ~3 gsutil calls per
# archived build -- tens of minutes over two weeks of history -- so the
# watermark is what makes a 15-minute cadence possible at all; only the first
# armed run (no data.json published yet) pays a sweep, and even that one is
# bounded to EVAL_DASHBOARD_SINCE_DAYS (default 14).
#
# This is a companion to publish_eval_dashboard in hack/ci-eval-pr.sh, with
# the OPPOSITE failure posture. The hook rides the eval job's EXIT trap, so it
# must never change that job's exit code and every failure collapses to one
# skip line. This script IS the job: a red periodic is the freshness alert,
# so past the dormancy/trust gates below every failure is `set -euo pipefail`
# loud, with the stage log preserved to $ARTIFACTS.
#
# What it shares with the hook, deliberately:
#   * DORMANCY: EVAL_DASHBOARD_TARGET unset -> one skip line, exit 0. The job
#     config arms the script; until the companion oss-test-infra PR exports
#     the target this file is inert wherever it runs.
#   * TRUST BOUNDARY: a pull request never writes the dashboard everyone
#     reads (a presubmit runs branch-authored code, and collect.py derives
#     `active` and coverage from THIS checkout). A gs:// target additionally
#     requires the main-branch job shape (JOB_TYPE periodic/postsubmit, no
#     PULL_NUMBER). A local-directory target has no trust boundary to cross,
#     which is what lets the unit tests and a laptop run the whole pipeline.
#   * ZERO-RUNS FLOOR between collect and render: collect.py warns and
#     continues when a listing fails, so a total source outage still yields a
#     well-formed document -- and in merge mode an empty result additionally
#     means the prior file was unusable AND the sweep found nothing.
#     Publishing that would overwrite a good dashboard with an empty one.
#   * One EVAL_DASHBOARD_TIMEOUT (default 900s) over the whole pipeline, with
#     the no-`timeout`-binary degrade-to-unbounded idiom, and the stage log
#     copied to $ARTIFACTS on success AND failure.
#
# Environment:
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_TARGET      gs://bucket/path or a local directory. Unset =
#                              dormant. (Live: gs://kube-agents-dashboards/evals/)
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_PR_GLOB     Prow build-dir glob(s) for collect.py; default
#                              below is the smoke-test presubmit's archive.
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_GITLAB_PR_GLOB  the GitLab lane's build-dir glob (tier
#                              gitlab, its own watermark); empty disables it
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_NIGHTLY_PREFIX  the nightly periodic's Prow log prefix,
#                              collected beside the presubmit as tier
#                              "nightly" (default below: the live job's).
#                              Empty disables the nightly scan. Not used on
#                              the EVAL_DASHBOARD_FROM_DIR path, which is
#                              offline by definition.
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_NIGHTLY_WRITERS_PREFIX  the same for the nightly's writers
#                              periodic, the second job of a night split
#                              across two (default below: the writers job's;
#                              until it has run there the prefix holds no
#                              objects, which collect.py notes and carries
#                              on). Its runs count as the writers part only
#                              when the prefix's last segment is
#                              ci-kube-agents-eval-nightly-writers. Empty
#                              disables it; offline as above.
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_SINCE_DAYS  sweep bound when no usable prior data exists
#                              (default 14).
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_STALE_AFTER_S  freshness-badge threshold written into
#                              data.json (default 2400 = 15m cadence x ~2.5)
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_TIMEOUT     whole-pipeline budget in seconds (default 900).
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_FROM_DIR    local build-dir source instead of the GCS glob
#                              -- the offline path the unit tests use. It also
#                              disarms EVAL_DASHBOARD_RC_GLOB, so a from-dir
#                              run reaches no bucket at all.
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_RC_GLOB     release-candidate build-dir glob, feeding the
#                              Brief's release-candidate table; default below is
#                              post-kube-agents-eval-rc's archive. Empty =
#                              leave releases[] to the prior data.json.
#   EVAL_DASHBOARD_RC_FROM_DIR local release-candidate source, the offline
#                              counterpart; wins over the glob when set.
#   JOB_TYPE / PULL_NUMBER     Prow's; gate bucket writes as above.
#   ARTIFACTS                  when set, receives eval-dashboard-refresh.log.
#
# The path of this file is a CONTRACT: the periodic job in oss-test-infra
# invokes hack/ci-dashboard-refresh.sh by name. Do not rename it.
