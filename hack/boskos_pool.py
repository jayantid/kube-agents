Shared by the out-of-band jobs and periodics that touch every pool project
from outside any run: the pull-request sweep (ci_sweep_agent_pulls.py),
the compute plants sweep (ci_sweep_compute_plants.py), and the fleet reconcile
(fleet_reconcile.py). Each acquires a project out of `free` into a hold
state, visits it, and releases it back, so a project a run holds is never
touched and a run arriving mid-visit waits at its own acquire. No listing
