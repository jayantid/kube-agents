# design, plus an unconditional label sweep of every cluster-scoped and
# namespaced kind the chart or the operator can create *with the part-of label*
# — because a run killed mid-install leaves objects with no Helm release record
# for `helm uninstall` to act on, and Helm then refuses to adopt them on the
# project's next lease (#1006). Step 4 names the kinds the label cannot reach.
#
# The CRD delete is the one conditional step: a release record that outlives
# Step 1 needs its CRDs, or the next lease can neither uninstall nor upgrade
# over it (#1172).

# The chart's pre-delete hook removes the PlatformAgent CR and waits for the
# operator to clear its finalizer, so one uninstall replaces the old
# per-step teardown scripts (09 LiteLLM, 08 CR, 07 secrets, 03 operator).
#
# When the uninstall fails and no revision is deployed, fall back to
# deleting the release-record Secrets directly (#1172). Teardown never
# deletes the namespace, so a no-deployed-revision record that survives here
# greets the project's next lease as `UPGRADE FAILED: "kube-agents" has no
# deployed releases` at ci-deploy.sh's `helm upgrade --install` — and the
# poisoned run's own teardown cannot remove it either, so the state is
# self-sustaining until something drops the record. The sweeps in Steps 3 and
# 4 already handle the objects the release owned, so this strands nothing a
# failed uninstall was not going to strand anyway.
#
# The deployed-revision gate is what makes the fallback safe on a *healthy*
# release whose uninstall failed transiently (pre-delete hook stuck, --wait
# past the timeout): its record is exactly what lets the next lease take the
# clean upgrade path over the surviving objects, so it stays. With no
# deployed revision the record is pure poison, and a probe that itself
# fails loses nothing — the delete is --ignore-not-found against a record
# that, if it exists at all, is already unusable. Same discipline as the
# rest of the file: nothing here may change the teardown's exit code, and
# the fallback logs what it deleted so a red run's artifacts show the heal
# happened.
