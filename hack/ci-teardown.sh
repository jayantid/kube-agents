# Prow CI Teardown Pipeline Script
# ==============================================================================
# Cleans up what a PR run leaves on the leased project's GKE cluster. Preserves
# static cluster & GCP IAM setup for fast re-use across PR runs. The agent's
# pull requests are swept elsewhere; see below.
#
# One `helm uninstall` (the release owns every Kubernetes object ci-deploy.sh
# created) plus a CRD delete, since the chart leaves CRDs behind by Helm's own
# design, plus an unconditional label sweep of every cluster-scoped and
# namespaced kind the chart or the operator can create *with the part-of label*
# — because a run killed mid-install leaves objects with no Helm release record
# for `helm uninstall` to act on, and Helm then refuses to adopt them on the
# project's next lease (#1006). Step 4 names the kinds the label cannot reach.
#
# One step is conditional. The CRD delete runs when a release record outlives
# Step 1, which needs its CRDs or the next lease can neither uninstall nor
# upgrade over it (#1172). The agent's leftover pull requests are not this
# script's to close: that takes a write credential, and a presubmit runs the
# pull request's own code, so the sweep runs from a periodic that executes only
# main (hack/ci_sweep_agent_pulls.py, #1755). Compute VPC networks, subnets and
# addresses planted by killed bench runs can be swept out-of-band using
# hack/ci_sweep_compute_plants.py (#2552).

#
# When the uninstall fails and no revision is deployed, fall back to
# deleting the release-record Secrets directly (#1172). Teardown never
# deletes the namespace, so a no-deployed-revision record that survives here
# greets the project's next lease as `UPGRADE FAILED: "kube-agents" has no

# poisoned run's own teardown cannot remove it either, so the state is
# self-sustaining until something drops the record. The sweeps in Steps 3 and
# 4 already handle the objects the release owned, so this strands nothing a
# failed uninstall was not going to strand anyway.
#
# The deployed-revision gate is what makes the fallback safe on a *healthy*
# release whose uninstall failed transiently (pre-delete hook stuck, --wait
# past the timeout): its record is exactly what lets the next lease take the
# clean upgrade path over the surviving objects, so it stays. With no
# deployed revision the record is pure poison, and a probe that itself
# fails loses nothing — the delete is --ignore-not-found against a record
# that, if it exists at all, is already unusable. Same discipline as the
