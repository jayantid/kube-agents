# Prints the candidate's commit SHA on stdout. Everything else goes to stderr,
# so the caller can do:
#
#   main() {
#     local rc_commit_sha
#     rc_commit_sha="$(hack/resolve-rc-target.sh)"
#     git checkout --detach "${rc_commit_sha}"
#     RC_COMMIT_SHA="${rc_commit_sha}" hack/ci-deploy.sh
#     exit $?
#   }
#   main "$@"
#
# The checkout is the caller's job and not this script's, and not
# hack/ci-deploy.sh's either. .github/workflows/deploy-environment.yml already
# settles this the same way — a second actions/checkout step at the candidate's
# SHA, before anything that reads the tree runs.
#
# The main() wrapper is not decoration. Bash reads a script incrementally as it
# executes, keeping a byte offset into the file, so a script that rewrites its
# own file mid-run can resume at that offset in different content. A checkout
# is usually the benign case — it replaces a file by rename, leaving the
# descriptor bash holds pointed at the intact original — but a tool that
# rewrites in place instead truncates the live inode, and then the offset lands
# in whatever is there now. "Usually", for a failure whose signature is a green
# run with steps missing from it, is not a property to build on. Wrapping the
# body removes the question: bash parses main() into memory in full before
# running any of it, and the exit means control never returns to the file. Copy
# the shape above rather than the three bare statements it wraps.
# hack/ci-eval-rc.sh is the worked example, and tests/test_ci_eval_rc.py pins
# the property by emptying that file mid-run.
#
# Checking out matters because only the images come from the candidate. The
# chart, the CRDs, bench/tasks, and the seeded fleet in bench/tf/fleet all come
# from whatever tree the job happens to be sitting on, so without the checkout
# an "RC eval" grades the candidate's images against main's everything-else.

# bridge belong to a mode: next install, which this path refuses
# (hack/ci-deploy.sh, RC_COMMIT_SHA with EVAL_MODE_NEXT). The gate

# the release path's answer; a shorter list here would be a second definition of
# a published commit, disagreeing with verify_release_eligibility.sh about which

# image blocks an eval that would not have installed it. Reach for the shorter
