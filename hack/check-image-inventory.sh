#
#   1. A pin drifts. The chart sat on LiteLLM v1.92.0 for a release while the
#      kustomize base it claimed to mirror was on v1.95.0. A mirror populated
#      from the inventory then lacks the tag the install asks for.
#   2. A new image appears with no inventory entry. Nothing copies it, and the
#      air-gapped install fails at pull time on a registry nobody approved.
#
# And one that has not happened yet: the Go builder pin matches the inventory
# but no longer satisfies k8s-operator/go.mod, so the image build fails, or a
# base without GOTOOLCHAIN=local builds with a toolchain nobody pinned.
#
# Run via `make images-check`; CI runs it in validate.yml.

# An off-by-default chart toggle: rendered unmirrored and mirrored on top of
# REQUIRED_VALUES, and checked against the default pair below. Without this the
# toggle's images reach no render at all and their pins sit behind every check
# — the gap #1139 was filed about.
#
# Only what the toggle adds is checked. Its render is a superset of the default
# pair, so passing the whole list would report a drifted LiteLLM pin once per
# configuration that renders LiteLLM, and the same message printed twice under
# two labels reads as two problems.
#
# Adding nothing is fatal. A toggle that has stopped turning on — a renamed
# value, a chart that now requires another key — takes its images back out of
# every check with everything still green, which is the original failure
# wearing a new coat.
#
# Adding the next toggle is one call. Hindsight, behind hindsight.enabled, is
# the one still uncovered.

#    install pulls it from a public registry after the install reported success.
