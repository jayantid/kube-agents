"""Mint a one-hour GitHub installation token from the ledger-reader App's key.

Shared by hack/ci-eval-pr.sh (grading's reads and the two resets) and by step 0,
hack/ci-revalidate.sh (its status reads: the /override check and the attestation). Everything secret or
caller-specific arrives through the environment, never argv:

  EVAL_LEDGER_APP_KEY_FILE   the App's private key (PEM); required
  LEDGER_MINT_BODY           the JSON body naming what the token may reach;
                             required and non-empty, see below
  EVAL_LEDGER_APP_ID         the App; defaults to the ledger-reader App
  EVAL_LEDGER_INSTALLATION_ID  its installation; defaults likewise

The one argument is the exit code to use for a failure another attempt could
survive (a 5xx, a 429, an unreachable api.github.com); any other failure exits
1. Passed in rather than duplicated so the two halves of the contract cannot
drift: the shell decides what it retries, this decides what is retryable.

Emits "<token> <expires_at>" on stdout and diagnostics on stderr.
