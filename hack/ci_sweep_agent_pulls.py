"""Close the platform agent's leftover pull requests in the pool's free projects.

A remediation scenario opens a pull request in the leased project's GitOps repo,
and nothing closed it. The next lease of that project meets its predecessor's:
`create_pull_request` in agents/platform/skills/submit-suggestion/scripts/
submit_suggestion.py treats "a pull request already exists" as success and
returns the old one's URL (#1755). The `pull_request_opened` check grades the
head commit, so an inherited pull request no longer passes as this run's work;
what it still costs is a repository that fills up, and a repetition reproducing
the same fix refused "nothing to commit" by the leftover branch.

Runs from a Prow periodic that executes only `main`, never a pull request's
code. That placement is the point: closing a pull request and deleting its
branch need `pull_requests: write` and `contents: write` on every pool
repository, and a presubmit runs the pull request's own scripts, so a write
credential mounted there is reachable by any change under test. Here the
credential is the agent's own GitHub App, signed through each project's KMS
key (the same key minty signs with in-cluster), by a service account only this
job runs as. The token is narrowed at mint to one repository and those two
writes; the key never leaves KMS.

Which projects: the ones Boskos hands out as `free`. Each is acquired into a
`cleaning` state for as long as its sweep takes -- seconds, or minutes after a
gap, the hold heartbeated -- and released back to `free`, so a project a run
holds is never touched, and a run arriving mid-sweep waits at its own acquire.
No listing endpoint is needed and no run's state is read.

The writes are paced to GitHub's published burst limits for an App -- a second
between writes, 500 writes an hour -- with a budget of writes per run past which
the rest waits for the next run, logged and reported; a write GitHub refuses
under its limit is retried once after the Retry-After it asks for, and refused
again the run ends rather than visiting every project during the cooldown; a
read it refuses under its limit ends the run at once, since the cooldown covers
the next project's mint and listing too. Every run writes a
report beside the job's artifacts (write_report), which the CI health bot reads.

Three conditions, all required, matching is_agent_pull_request in
agents/platform/scripts/forge.py: authored by the agent's bot, head branch
carrying the agent's prefix, and that branch in the repository itself rather
than a fork. The head branch goes with the pull request: submit_suggestion.py
starts from the remote branch when it exists and refuses "nothing to commit"
when the new tree matches it, so a closed pull request whose branch stayed
would still cost the next lease a repetition (#1755 item 2). Branches under
the prefix with no open pull request are deleted too, so a delete that failed
or a run killed between a close and its delete is caught up by the next run.
