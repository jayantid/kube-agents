"""Close the platform agent's leftover pull requests in the pool's free projects.

A remediation scenario opens a pull request in the leased project's GitOps repo,
and nothing closed it. The next lease of that project meets its predecessor's:
`create_pull_request` in agents/platform/skills/submit-suggestion/scripts/
submit_suggestion.py treats "a pull request already exists" as success and
returns the old one's URL (#1755). The `pull_request_opened` check grades the
head commit, so an inherited pull request no longer passes as this run's work;
what it still costs is a repository that fills up, and a repetition reproducing
the same fix refused "nothing to commit" by the leftover branch.

Runs from a Prow periodic that executes only `main`, never a pull request's
code, as the backstop behind the in-job reset (hack/ci_reset_agent_pulls.py,
which the eval job runs at lease time and before every unit that may write):
a run killed hard leaves its last unit's pull request, and this closes it once
the project is free again. The credential is the agent's own GitHub App,
signed through each project's KMS key (the same key minty signs with
in-cluster), by a service account only this job runs as. The token is narrowed
at mint to one repository and the three writes made here (label, close, delete
the branch); the key never leaves KMS.

Which projects: the ones Boskos hands out as `free`. Each is acquired into a
`cleaning` state for as long as its sweep takes -- seconds, or minutes after a
gap, the hold heartbeated -- and released back to `free`, so a project a run
holds is never touched, and a run arriving mid-sweep waits at its own acquire.
No listing endpoint is needed and no run's state is read.

The writes are paced to GitHub's published burst limits for an App -- a second
between writes, 500 writes an hour -- with a budget of writes per run past which
the rest waits for the next run, logged and reported; a write GitHub refuses
under its limit is retried once after the Retry-After it asks for, and refused
again the run ends rather than visiting every project during the cooldown; a
read it refuses under its limit ends the run at once, since the cooldown covers
the next project's mint and listing too. Every run writes a
report beside the job's artifacts (write_report), which the CI health bot reads.

Two conditions, both required: authored by the agent's bot, and the head
branch in the repository itself rather than a fork. Not the branch name: the
agent names its own branches when it pushes with git from its sandbox, and
42 of the 60 pull requests open across the pool on 2026-10-01 carried no
`platform-agent/` prefix (#2260). A pull request carrying `audit:remediation`
is labelled `audit:stale-closed` before it is closed, which is how the fleet
audit tells a harness close from a human's refusal (#2228). The head branch
goes with the pull request: submit_suggestion.py starts from the remote
branch when it exists and refuses "nothing to commit" when the new tree
matches it (#1755 item 2). Every other branch but the default goes too: a
pool repository is a fixture nothing else keeps branches in, so a branch with
no open pull request is a leftover whatever its name.

`--forge gitlab` is the same pass over the pool's GitLab projects
(kube-agents#2394): the closer is hack/ci_gitlab_forge.py, the credential the
pool's one agent token read from Secret Manager, and the report
pull-sweep-gitlab.json. That pass has a second job, the only rotation-related
one anything automated does: it reads both tokens' expiry into the report
(gitlab_tokens) and warns from 30 days out, naming the token, so the yearly
human rotation is flagged while it can still be done with overlap
(docs/ci-pool-projects.md 5.6). A token that is merely due does not fail the
run -- a month of red sweeps would read as failed projects -- but one that is
dead or could not be checked does. CI health's read of the report is
kube-agents#2571.
