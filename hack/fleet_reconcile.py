"""Re-apply the seeded fleet stack in pool projects, from outside any run.

bench/tf/fleet plants the defects the presubmit's fixture scenarios assert on,
and the fleet drifts: GKE auto-upgrade heals seeded-b's version lag once its
maintenance exclusion lapses, a node repair leaves a fixture Pending, a cleanup
deletes the orphan disk. The stack's own README says the reconcile is a
re-apply on a schedule; this is that schedule's script.

Runs from two Prow periodics that execute only `main`, never a pull request's
code, as an identity of its own (docs/ci-pool-projects.md, section 6.2):
hourly against the projects the CI health bot's fixture-state scan reports
drifted, and weekly against every project, which is what rolls seeded-b's
exclusion forward. A presubmit runs the pull request's own scripts, so a
credential that can rewrite the fleet is never mounted there.

Each project is acquired from Boskos out of `free` into `reconciling` for the
minutes the apply takes and released back, so a project a run holds is never
applied under it and a run arriving mid-apply waits at its own acquire. The
plan is inspected before it is applied: only creates and in-place updates
are applied, and a plan with anything else (a destroy, a replace, a forget)
is refused and named, because nothing this stack declares should ever need
that on a re-apply, and a plan that does is a code change or an incident a
person should look at first.

`--report` writes fleet-reconcile.json (mode, dry run, exit, error, the
per-project outcomes and a summary), under $ARTIFACTS when Prow sets it, for
the CI health bot to read (scripts/eval_dashboard/periodics.py).
