"""Re-apply the seeded fleet stack in pool projects, from outside any run.

bench/tf/fleet plants the defects the presubmit's fixture scenarios assert on,
and the fleet drifts: GKE auto-upgrade heals seeded-b's version lag once its
maintenance exclusion lapses, a node repair leaves a fixture Pending, a cleanup
deletes the orphan disk. The stack's own README says the reconcile is a
re-apply on a schedule; this is that schedule's script.

Runs from Prow, only ever from `main`, as an identity of its own
(docs/ci-pool-projects.md, section 6.2): a postsubmit on every merge that
touches the stack, and a daily pass over every project, which is also what
rolls seeded-b's exclusion forward. A presubmit runs the pull request's own
scripts, so a credential that can rewrite the fleet is never mounted there.

Each project is acquired from Boskos out of `free` into `reconciling` for the
minutes the apply takes and released back, so a project a run holds is never
applied under it and a run arriving mid-apply waits at its own acquire. `--all`
asks for every mapped project by name and keeps asking for the busy ones until
the run's budget is spent; `--workers` holds several at once, each under its
own lease. The plan is inspected before it is applied: creates and in-place
updates are applied; a delete or a replace only when bench/tf/fleet's
allowlist declares that address (reconcile-allow.json, reviewed with the
change that needs it); anything else is refused and named. A plan whose only
change is seeded-b's exclusion re-stamp is `converged`, decided on the fields
that changed, not the address.

A run never starts a project it cannot finish inside its budget, and stops
when main's fleet tree is no longer the one it checked out, so two runs at
different commits never apply over each other. `--report` writes
fleet-reconcile.json (mode, commit, tree, per-project outcomes with times, a
summary), under $ARTIFACTS when Prow sets it, for the CI health bot
(scripts/eval_dashboard/periodics.py); each applied project also gets
`applied.json` in its state bucket, the record of which commit it is at.
