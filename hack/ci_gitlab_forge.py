"""The GitLab half of the eval's repository hygiene (kube-agents#2394).

Three callers share this: hack/ci_reset_audit_ledgers.py (close the open
ledger issues), hack/ci_reset_agent_pulls.py (close the agent's merge requests
and delete every branch but the default) and hack/ci_sweep_agent_pulls.py (the
same closes across the free pool projects, plus the token expiry warning),
each under `--forge gitlab`. The GitHub halves stay in those files; this one
mirrors their rules against GitLab's API shapes:

* one private project per pool project, `gke-agentic/<PROJECT_ID>-infra`
  (`gitlab_project_for_project()` in hack/ci-deploy.sh); `expected_project`
  refuses any other pair, as the GitHub guard does;
* the agent is the bot account the token belongs to (`kube-agents-eval-bot`
  today; read from the token, as the GitHub sweep reads the App's slug), an
  ordinary user with a personal access token (gitlab.com Free has no bot
  tokens), so "the agent's" means authored by that login and, for a merge
  request, from a branch in the project itself rather than a fork;
* a ledger is an open issue carrying `agent:audit` (and `audit:<id>` when a
  stream is named), titled `[audit] `, by the bot; it is closed with a note
  that opens with the GitHub reset's RESET_MARKER (the bench's GitLab ledger
  check, kube-agents#2433, reads it from the issue's notes as the GitHub one
  reads it from comments), then `state_event: close`;
* one token pair serves the whole pool and nothing here rotates it: GitLab's
  rotate call revokes the old token the moment it returns, with no overlap, so
  rotation is a human's yearly step (docs/ci-pool-projects.md 5.6) and the
  sweep's job is to say, through `token_expiry`, when that step is due.

Every token arrives through the environment or a function argument, never on
argv. `api` is the one network seam; the tests replace it.
