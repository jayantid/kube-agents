"""Wait until no run of the named audits is going on the Platform Agent. Runs in the agent container.

Usage: python3 - <home> <bound-seconds> <poll-seconds> <audit-id>... < ci_platform_runs.py

hack/ci-eval-pr.sh pipes this into the gateway before a unit on those audit streams
runs (wait_platform_runs). A run the install started for itself -- a scheduled one,
or one the `oobe` stage marked due -- writes the stream's ledger issue like the
unit's own, so the unit waits for it rather than resetting the ledger under it.

Counts a run claimed or running, and an audit marked due (or overdue) and not yet
claimed, since the next profile-cron-tick starts it. A row claimed more than
``STALE_SECONDS`` ago is not counted: a gateway restart leaves a cut-off run's row
at running for good, and no audit takes that long. Anything it cannot read counts
as busy, so a failed read is waited out rather than taken as idle.

While the Chat Agent's `oobe` stage has started its chain and is not done, the
audit it marks next counts too, before it is marked: a unit that started then would have its own worker's
`start` refused once the stage's run took the stream's in-flight note. Only the
next one, and only once the chain has started (before that the stage waits on the
onboarding scan, for as long as an hour and more): waiting out the scan or the whole
chain would hold every audit case on those streams for most of an hour. While the oobe-first-run-audits stack has the stage armed (its
state file is there: the chain overran or the teardown could not disarm), every
audit the stage has still to mark counts. The audit awaiting its run counts in both
cases, since the stage records a mark before the store has it. An audit has had its
turn once its run has ended, or it was held or given up on; a mark never claimed is
taken back and the audit counts again. The stage's
audit list and order are read from the image's copy of oobe.py, not run.

Prints one line: how long it waited and what was still going when it stopped.
