"""Close the open audit ledger issues in ONE leased project's GitOps repository.

A fleet-audit stream keeps one open issue per audit in the project's GitOps
repository (`gke-agentic/<project>-infra`): `audit_report.py start` finds it as
the highest open issue labelled `audit:<id>` and, since #1691, hands the worker
every finding its body carries by name; `finish` rewrites it. Nothing closes
it between eval runs, so on a pool project every repetition of an audit case
starts with the ledger the previous lease -- and, inside one run, the previous
repetition -- left behind, carrying the planted defect already. A repetition
can then pass by keeping a carried finding rather than finding it, and a false
clean close by repetition 2 leaves repetition 3 a different start than 1.

This closes those issues so the next `start` finds none and opens a fresh
ledger. hack/ci-eval-pr.sh calls it twice: once when the lease begins, for
every audit stream, and once per repetition of an audit case, for that stream
alone, under the case's task lock. Every repetition therefore audits from an
empty ledger; the price is one closed issue per repetition in a repository
that exists to be written to.

What it will not do:

* touch any repository but the leased project's. The caller names both, and
  `expected_repo` refuses a pair that does not match; the token the caller
  minted is narrowed to that one repository as well, so the two guards fail
  independently.
* close an issue that is not a ledger. Three conditions, all required: the
  `agent:audit` label (and `audit:<id>` when one stream is named), the
  `[audit] ` title prefix `render_issue_title` writes, and a `[bot]` author.
  A human's issue in the repository, labelled or not, stays open.
* delete anything. Closing is a state change with a comment naming the eval
  build; the issue and its history stay readable. The comment opens with a
  fixed marker (`RESET_MARKER`) that the `ledger_issue_contains` check reads
  back, so a report that still cites a retired ledger is graded as a stale
  pointer to the harness's close, not as a run that closed its own ledger.
  The check binds the marker to the close time, so a comment whose close
  then failed (the ledger stays open) cannot lend the harness's name to a
  close somebody else makes later.

The token arrives in the environment (`LEDGER_RESET_TOKEN`), never on argv
where `ps` would show it. `--dry-run` lists what would close and writes
nothing, which is how this is checked from a laptop with a personal token.
