"""Assert that the seeded fleet's planted fixtures are in their DESIGNED state.

hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh confirms that every object a fixture role names is
PRESENT before it publishes the role's kubeconfig. Presence is not state: on
2026-09-07 a GKE auto-upgrade rebuilt seeded-a's single node, the system pods
took all of its CPU, `payments-api` and `checkout-gateway` sat Pending on all
30 pool projects, every presence probe kept passing, and the gate went red on
every pull request for a day (#1278). This script is the other half (#1544): for
each role the runner published it reads the `state` assertions the catalog
(bench/tf/fleet/fixtures.json) declares -- the crashloop has recorded an
OOMKilled termination, the healthy workloads are Ready, the idle pool's node is
Ready and tainted, slot b's control plane is still one minor behind its
channel -- and reports the roles whose fixture is there but not in the shape
the cases depend on.

It runs in two places. `scripts/verify_ci_pool_project.py` runs it after the
presence pass and fails a project whose fixtures have drifted. The CI health
bot's hourly scan (`scripts/eval_dashboard/fixture_state.py`, #1550) runs it
against every pool project with `--report`, which writes each role's verdict
as JSON beside the summary so the scan need not parse the warnings. Detection
is this script's whole job -- nothing here, and nothing in the presubmit, acts
on a drift.
`--wait` is for a fixture that has just been rescheduled -- the crashloop needs
its first restart before OOMKilled evidence exists -- and keeps re-reading a
role that is positively out of shape until it converges or the deadline
passes. A role whose reads fail does not hold the wait: nothing about it can
converge, so it is re-read only while some other role is worth waiting for. A
role still drifted at the deadline gets a `<role>.drift` file beside its
kubeconfig, one failed assertion per line with what was observed, which is the
output contract a consumer reads.

What it never does: mutate anything (every read is `kubectl get -o json` or
`gcloud container clusters describe`), address a cluster it discovered itself
(the runner recorded each slot's cluster and location in `.fleet-context`), or
kill the job. Weather -- an unreachable API server, a refused describe -- leaves
the role "not checked" with a warning and no drift file; only positive
evidence of a fixture out of shape counts as drift. A malformed catalog is a
repository bug and exits 1.

Usage:
    hack/fleet-fixture-state.py [--dir DIR] [--catalog PATH] [--project ID]
                                [--wait SECONDS] [--interval SECONDS]
                                [--report PATH]

Inputs (flags win over the environment):
    BENCH_FLEET_KUBECONFIG_DIR         the directory hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh wrote
    FLEET_CATALOG                      path to fixtures.json
    FLEET_PROJECT_ID / PROJECT_ID      named in messages; `.fleet-context` wins
    FLEET_FIXTURE_STATE_WAIT_SECONDS   how long to poll for convergence (default 0)

Output: everything goes to stderr, ending in one summary line:

    Seeded-fleet fixture state: N role(s) in their designed state, D drifted,
    U not checked (project P)

With `--report PATH` the same verdicts are written as JSON, one entry per
catalog role: `converged`, `drifted` or `unchecked` with the lines above as
`detail`, `unpublished` for a role the runner wrote no kubeconfig for, and
`no_state` for one that declares no assertions.

Exit 0 whenever the fleet was looked at, whatever it found; 1 on a repository
bug (unreadable catalog, malformed `state` entry, missing directory).
