# Seeded-fleet kubeconfigs, one per fixture ROLE
# ==============================================================================
# Cluster-state checks against the seeded fleet (bench/tf/fleet/) cannot use the
# ambient kubeconfig. ci-eval-pr.sh authenticates once, to platform-agent-host,
# and never switches context; the seeded namespaces are on other clusters
# entirely, so `kubectl get deployment payments-api -n seeded-debug` resolves
# against a cluster that has no such namespace. This script is the other half of
# the fix (bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md, blocker A5): it fetches credentials for the
# seeded clusters into their OWN files and leaves the ambient kubeconfig alone.
#
# The files are keyed by fixture ROLE, never by cluster name and never by
# project. Each eval project carries its own trio of seeded clusters, so a case
# that named `seeded-a` would be a case that only runs in one project. A case
# names `fixture_role: crashloop-workload`; bench/tf/fleet/fixtures.json says
# which SLOT of the trio that role lives on; this script finds the leased
# project's trio and matches each cluster to its slot. The catalog is the only
# place the role->slot mapping exists -- the verifier never re-derives it, it
# just opens "${BENCH_FLEET_KUBECONFIG_DIR}/<role>.kubeconfig".
#
# Clusters are DISCOVERED BY LABEL, not composed from a name:
#
#   resourceLabels.environment=seeded AND
#   resourceLabels.managed-by=kube-agents-seeded-fleet
#
# which is exactly `local.cluster_labels` in bench/tf/fleet/main.tf and is
# carried by the trio and by nothing else in an eval project (neither
# platform-agent-host nor the per-run eval-pr-* clusters have either label).
# Composing "${prefix}-${slot}" from catalog constants instead would silently
# address the wrong thing the first time someone applies the stack with a
# non-default -var cluster_prefix or into another region: the name would still
# be well-formed, so the failure would arrive as a check result rather than as
# an error here. The slot is read back off the discovered name's trailing
# "-<slot>" segment, so the prefix and the location stay the Terraform's
# business.
#
# A cluster that cannot be reached leaves its roles' files ABSENT rather than
# stale or wrong, and this script still exits 0. (A leased project where the
# stack was never applied has no reader account either, so it stops at the
# credential gate below instead.) That is deliberate: the verifier turns a
# missing file into `status: "error"` naming the role AND the project, which
# fails exactly the checks that needed that cluster instead of the whole job,
# and it never falls back to the ambient kubeconfig -- falling back is the bug
# this script exists to remove.
#
# A role's file is only written once EVERY object in its catalog `probes` list
# has been SEEN on the slot's cluster, before the agent runs, and the list of
# what was seen is written beside it as "<role>.confirmed". A labelled cluster
# is not the same thing as a planted fixture -- an apply that created the
# clusters and stopped before the Kubernetes provider ran leaves a trio that
# answers every API call and holds none of the objects -- and the verifier's
# whole fail/error distinction rests on being able to say an object that is
# gone AT CHECK TIME went missing DURING the run. Confirming it here is what
# makes that true, and confirming it PER OBJECT rather than per namespace is
# what makes it true for the roles that have no namespace: the cluster-scoped
# ones, which a namespace-only gate waved through and so let a
# check on a live-but-empty cluster blame an agent that touched nothing. A
# fixture that was never planted leaves the role unresolvable, which is an
# error about the environment, not a failure blamed on the agent.
