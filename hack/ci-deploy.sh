# The session daemon caps Warning alerts at 5 per UTC day, fleet-wide per
# install (ALERT_DAILY_LIMIT_WARNING, #641). That cap is alert-storm
# protection for a human-watched channel; an eval install's whole job is
# generating alerts. Every smoke build that leases a pool project that day
# spends the same shared budget on its own crash-loop scenarios, and once it
# is gone the daemon quota-suppresses the very alert
# autoops-warning-event-triage waits 300s for, timing out the plant (#1101).
# 0 is the documented off-switch — `_alert_daily_limit` in
# agents/platform/scripts/session_kv_server.py parses it as "cap off" and
# `_claim_alert_quota` lets `limit <= 0` through uncapped — and setting it
# here, on the deploy, leaves the production
# default untouched. tests/test_ci_deploy_alert_quota.py pins the whole
# chain: this flag, the chart rendering it onto the CR, and the operator's
# env allowlist letting it through to the container.

# The kanban board's worker cap on the eval install. The image ships
# kanban.max_in_progress: 2 (agents/chat/config.yaml), a floor for an install
# that has not measured its own worker footprint, and the operator renders a
# different cap only when the CR carries spec.harness.tuning.maxInProgress.
# The eval fans its units out at EVAL_TASK_PARALLELISM (4 on a pull request,
# 8 on the nightly since oss-test-infra#2707), and nearly every unit's
# opening turn delegates one platform card, so on the image default most
# lanes queue behind two slots: a queued card waits out the cards ahead of
# it and then runs its own 10-45 minutes, past the 2700-3000s delegation
# ceiling with no worker at fault, while the dispatcher logs the same "ready
# queue non-empty ... 0 workers spawned" warning a wedged worker produces
# (#1879, #1880). This bounds the queueing share of what remained after
# their fixes (#2032); the same nightly also had workers wedged for a whole
# delegation by the v2026.9.14 base's approval-regex hang on large terminal
# commands, a separate holder of the same slots that the Hermes bump removes.
#
# Five, not the lane count. The cap bounds ACTIVE workers, and a coordinator
# waiting on the children it fanned out gives its slot back but stays
# resident (deploy/docker/patches/kanban_scheduling.py, Part 4), so the
# process count is the cap plus the waiting coordinators. The gateway
# container's 8Gi memory limit (resolveResources in
# k8s-operator/internal/controller/manifest_helpers.go) was sized for five
# concurrent workers over a 1.8GiB idle set, and a worker the cgroup OOM
# killer takes strands its card with no restart and no event: the same shape
# as the queue this removes, indistinguishable from it in the run record. So
# the cap stops where the sizing stops: five covers the pull request's four
# lanes with one slot for a fan-out child, and the nightly's eight lanes
# still queue three deep until the working set at five is measured and the
# eval install's memory limit is raised together with the cap (the CR patch
# hack/kind-up.sh makes after helm is the shape; #2032 carries the
# measurement). Set on this install only, so the production default stays
# where the CRD reference argues it should. tests/test_ci_deploy_kanban_cap.py

# (#1686, measuring #1661). Unset, or set to

#
# What the flag has to do, and where:
#   - section 2a refuses it on the release-candidate path (that path builds
#     no bridge sidecar and declares none from the release) and section 2b refuses it on a Prow
#     run that is neither a pull request's nor one of the next-lane jobs
#     named below (a mis-set variable on the nightly or a postsubmit would
#     otherwise run that job in next mode, recording and publishing nothing,
#     so main's window and dashboard would silently miss it), and refuses a
#     fan-out the bridge cannot be given as its concurrency, before anything
#     is built;
#   - step 4 also builds the A2A gateway, auth callout and worker images from
#     a2a/Dockerfile.* (the pull request's own builds, the same way the four
#     images above are; the operator would derive these same references from
#     its own image, and step 5 names them anyway so the deploy's inputs are
#     explicit) and the Hermes bridge sidecar image, FROM the
#     platform-agent image of the same build;
#   - step 5 passes those references to the operator through the chart's
#     operator.extraEnv, which the operator reads as its image overrides, and
#     arms the gateway's inject door the same way (A2A_INJECT_BACKEND=true);
#   - step 6b patches the CR (the mode, and the maxSessions section 2b sized
#     for the sidecar to come), waits for the agent Deployment to roll, gates
#     on the NATS StatefulSet, the callout Deployment, the provisioning Job
#     and the agent Deployment, in that order, waits for the inject door's
#     Service and token Secret, declares the bridge sidecar on the CR, waits

# hack/ci-eval-pr.sh then runs the matrix through the door (AGENT_TRANSPORT=

# ─── 2b. GitOps Repository for This Run ───────────────────────────────────────
# Every GitHub-writing eval scenario begins by reading the registered repositories
# out of the gitops-state ConfigMap — the fleet-audit streams do it in `audit_report.py
# start`, before anything else happens. The operator seeds that entry from
# spec.integration.github.gitRepo on the PlatformAgent CR; with the field unset
# no repository is registered and those scenarios stop at step 0 with nothing to clone.
#
# CI supplies the value and deliberately does NOT lean on the chart default.
# On the presubmit path everything this job deploys — chart, operator, agent —
# is built from the pull request, so a PR that blanks
# `platformAgent.integration.github.gitRepo` in values.yaml, or breaks the
# CR-to-ConfigMap seeding, is precisely the regression the eval should catch
# as a failed scenario. It can only catch it if the value the run is supposed to
# use arrives from outside the artefacts under test. The release-candidate path
# installs published images instead of built ones, which narrows what is under
# test without changing this argument: the chart still comes from the checkout,
# and supplying the value from outside is what keeps either artefact from
# choosing it. Note this is a *correctness* argument, not the containment
# boundary: what a run can actually write to is fixed by which repositories the
# GitHub App is installed on, which no PR can change. See
# docs/ci-pool-projects.md.
#
# One GitOps repo per leasable project, so two concurrent leases can never
# share a ledger issue or race on a remediation branch. Onboarding a further
# project (issue #637, Boskos leasing) is one line here plus the same pair in
# _EXPECTED_MAPPING in tests/test_ci_gitops_repo.py — no other edit in this file.
#
# A mapping here is a claim that the repo exists and that App 4675512 is
# installed on it. It is not self-verifying: with the line present and either
# of those missing, the deploy succeeds and every GitHub-writing scenario
# fails at `audit_report.py start` with a clone or token error instead of the
# named, actionable refusal below. Add the row when the repo and the
# installation are real, not when the project joins the Boskos pool — the two
# are separate events, and kube-agents-evals-3 is what happens when they are
# assumed to be one.

# ─── 5. Chart Deployment ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# One helm release carries the whole install — operator, credentials Secret,
# agent CR, and LiteLLM — so there is nothing to apply piecemeal or keep in order.
#
# The chart is `./charts/kube-agents`, out of the checkout, on both paths. On the
# release-candidate path that makes the checkout load-bearing: the images come
# from RC_COMMIT_SHA and the chart, CRDs and eval tasks come from whatever tree
# this runs in, so the caller has to have checked the tree out at that commit
# first or the run grades the candidate's images against another revision's
# everything-else. hack/resolve-rc-target.sh is where that contract is written
# down, and .github/workflows/deploy-environment.yml is the existing precedent
# for honouring it with a checkout step.
# Webhooks stay at the chart's default (off): a PR evaluation cluster carries
# no cert-manager, and admission-webhook coverage belongs to the operator's
# own test suite rather than this smoke pipeline.
#
# runtimeClassName is pinned empty rather than left at the chart's default,
# which is `gvisor`. Step 7 reaches the agent over `kubectl port-forward`, and
# that does not work against a sandboxed pod -- the forward is set up in the
# host-side CNI netns while the listener lives in the sandbox's own network
# stack, so the connection is refused
# (docs/site/src/content/docs/operator/platformagent-crd.md is canonical on
# this; scripts/exec_tunnel.py is the relay that reaches one instead, as
# tests/e2e does). On a pool cluster with no `gvisor` RuntimeClass the pod
# would not schedule at all. Either way this job wants the standard runtime;
# what the sandbox does to the agent is the release pipeline's to exercise,
# not a smoke test's.

# ─── 6b. EVAL_MODE_NEXT: switch to spec.mode: next and gate the bus ──────────
# Everything above proved the today-mode install. From here the CR is patched
# and the gates run over what `mode: next` adds, in dependency order: the NATS
# StatefulSet (the bus), the callout Deployment (the Job below cannot
# authenticate to NATS without it), the provisioning Job (the streams; until
# it completes there is nothing on the bus), and then the agent Deployment,
# which the operator rolls when it pins the mode into the managed .env and
# the config hash moves. The Deployment's generation is recorded before the
# patch: `rollout status` right after it would answer for the today
# ReplicaSet, before the operator has reconciled anything.
#
# Then the door and the executor, which the eval's transport needs and the
# mode alone does not give it. The inject door's Service and token Secret are
# waited for (the operator renders them only with the flag step 5 set on it;
# hack/ci-eval-pr.sh reads that Secret). The bridge sidecar is declared on
# the CR through spec.deployment.sidecars only now, after the bus is up: a
# bridge that starts before NATS resolves crash-loops in the agent's pod and
# holds the pod NotReady (a2a/docs/hermes-bridge.md, "What this deployment
# method costs"). That declaration rolls the agent Deployment once more, and
# re-renders the provisioning Job, because the sidecar's BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY
# is an input to the TASKS consumer budget: the step waits for that second
# run and reads the CR's phase after it, so a refusal reds the lane instead
# of parking the CR Degraded while the step proceeds (#2077). The first patch
# carries the maxSessions section 2b sized so that second budget fits the
# stream the first run created (the constants block says the arithmetic).
# Then the step ends on the bridge's own word that it is consuming `platform`
# tasks; until then the bus has an executor for nobody and every case on the
# inject transport ends as infrastructure. The teardown's `helm uninstall`
# removes the CR whole, so the flip-back-with-sidecar failure the bridge doc
# names never arises here.
#
# Reported, not gated: the A2A gateway Deployment. It used to exit on start
# without a chat backend (#1660); the inject door is one, so it now starts,
# but no pool-project run has shown it coming up yet and a gateway that is
# down is what the harness classifies as infrastructure on every case rather
# than a deploy failure. Gating it is the change that follows the first
# measured run through the door. Not gated either: the shell StatefulSet,
# which does not change under next.
#
# Every A2A pod the operator renders carries CPU and memory requests and
# limits (#1700), so a namespace ResourceQuota on limits.cpu admits them;
# nothing this deploy or the chart renders carries such a quota either way.
