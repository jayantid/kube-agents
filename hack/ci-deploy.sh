# Setting RC_COMMIT_SHA switches it to the release-candidate path: no build at

# Setting EVAL_MODE_NEXT=1 flips the installed agent to `spec.mode: next` after

# The session daemon caps Warning alerts at 5 per UTC day, fleet-wide per
# install (ALERT_DAILY_LIMIT_WARNING, #641). That cap is alert-storm
# protection for a human-watched channel; an eval install's whole job is
# generating alerts. Every smoke build that leases a pool project that day
# spends the same shared budget on its own crash-loop scenarios, and once it
# is gone the daemon quota-suppresses the very alert
# autoops-warning-event-triage waits 300s for, timing out the plant (#1101).
# 0 is the documented off-switch — `_alert_daily_limit` in
# agents/platform/scripts/session_kv_server.py parses it as "cap off" and
# `_claim_alert_quota` lets `limit <= 0` through uncapped — and setting it
# here, on the deploy, leaves the production
# default untouched. tests/test_ci_deploy_alert_quota.py pins the whole
# chain: this flag, the chart rendering it onto the CR, and the operator's
# env allowlist letting it through to the container.
readonly EVAL_ALERT_DAILY_LIMIT_WARNING="0"

# The drift bucket's own ceiling, off for the same reason and by the same
# mechanism. A drift case spends one inject per audit record that survives the
# classifier, and the regression it is there to catch — a classifier that stops
# filtering — spends one per record that should have been dropped, so the
# failing run is the one that needs the most headroom. A finite ceiling is worse
# than no ceiling here rather than merely tighter: a repetition that begins with
# one slot left files a card for the first record and is refused the rest, which
# is what a working filter looks like from the outside. Uncapped, an unfiltered
# pipeline files every card it should not have and the case reds.
#
# What that costs, stated rather than discovered: one lease deploys one install
# and runs the whole matrix against it, so this ceiling is off for every case
# rather than for drift ones, and the board it fills is shared
# (kanban.max_in_progress is 2). A single human-tier record therefore files
# unbounded cards and can starve unrelated cases in the same lease. On a leased
# pool project almost every principal is a service account and the classifier
# drops it, so the steady state is quiet; the triggers are a maintainer running
# kubectl against a leased cluster mid-run, a `user:` principal in the project,
# the classifier regression this setting exists to expose, and the backlog
# below. Accepted because a finite cap makes that regression green, which is
# the failure that matters.
#
# The backlog is the widest of those and is not bounded by the lease. The sink
# exports every cluster in the project and the subscription keeps what nothing
# has acked for terraform/modules/drift-pubsub's default 31 days, never
# expiring; teardown uninstalls the chart, so no detector pulls between leases.
# Each lease therefore opens on everything human-tier logged since the last one
# drained — on a freshly provisioned project, including the provisioning. This
# script cannot drain it: seeking the subscription needs
# pubsub.subscriptions.seek, and provision_ci_pool_project.sh gives the runner
# roles/viewer, which carries get and list and not that. Shortening retention
# for pool projects is the fix and is a tfvars change rather than one made
# here; #2491 tracks it.
readonly EVAL_ALERT_DAILY_LIMIT_DRIFT="0"

# The subscription the drift detector pulls from. The pool project's own
# provisioning owns the resource: scripts/provision_ci_pool_project.sh sets

# drift-pubsub creates the sink, the topic and this subscription and grants
# kubeagents-platform-gsa subscriber and viewer on it. Nothing is created here
# — the install has one engine, and a `gcloud pubsub create` beside the module
# would be a second expression of the same step.
#
# The name is restated rather than read back because this helm upgrade replaces
# the composition's whole value set, the subscription included, so an install
# that had it loses it unless the deploy puts it back. It has to stay equal to

# credentials, and the ack-deadline read -- each of which otherwise exits the

# Deliberately not --log-dropped here, though the detector takes it and
# deploy/shared/start-services.sh will pass it on any install that sets
# DRIFT_DETECTOR_LOG_DROPPED through spec.deployment.env. One deploy serves the
# whole eval matrix, so the cost is paid by every lease rather than by drift
# cases: the post-sink stream runs 1 to 10 records a second and is about 98%
# system tier (terraform/modules/drift-pubsub/main.tf measures ~60k/day on a
# two-cluster project, and a pool project carries the host cluster plus the
# seeded fleet), so a line per drop is most of the audit stream copied into the
# sidecar's stderr and shipped on to Cloud Logging.
#
# A fixture does not need it to tell an empty ingress from an over-eager
# filter. The detector already prints `idle, no messages delivered in %s
# (parsed=%d skipped=%d failed=%d)` on a timer and `pull failed, retrying` when
# the subscription cannot be read (k8s-operator/cmd/drift-detector/
# subscriber.go), which separates the three states; `skipped` is the count a
# noise-filter case asserts on. What --log-dropped adds over that is which
# record and why, and that is worth a targeted rerun rather than every lease.

# The kanban board's worker cap on the eval install. The image ships
# kanban.max_in_progress: 2 (agents/chat/config.yaml), a floor for an install
# that has not measured its own worker footprint, and the operator renders a
# different cap only when the CR carries spec.harness.tuning.maxInProgress.
# The eval fans its units out at EVAL_TASK_PARALLELISM (4 on a pull request,
# 8 on the nightly since oss-test-infra#2707), and nearly every unit's
# opening turn delegates one platform card, so on the image default most
# lanes queue behind two slots: a queued card waits out the cards ahead of
# it and then runs its own 10-45 minutes, past the 2700-3000s delegation
# ceiling with no worker at fault, while the dispatcher logs the same "ready
# queue non-empty ... 0 workers spawned" warning a wedged worker produces
# (#1879, #1880). This bounds the queueing share of what remained after
# their fixes (#2032); the same nightly also had workers wedged for a whole
# delegation by the v2026.9.14 base's approval-regex hang on large terminal
# commands, a separate holder of the same slots that the Hermes bump removes.
#
# Five, not the lane count. The cap bounds ACTIVE workers, and a coordinator
# waiting on the children it fanned out gives its slot back but stays
# resident (deploy/docker/patches/kanban_scheduling.py, Part 4), so the
# process count is the cap plus the waiting coordinators. The gateway
# container's 8Gi memory limit (resolveResources in
# k8s-operator/internal/controller/manifest_helpers.go) was sized for five
# concurrent workers over a 1.8GiB idle set, and a worker the cgroup OOM
# killer takes strands its card with no restart and no event: the same shape
# as the queue this removes, indistinguishable from it in the run record. So
# the cap stops where the sizing stops: five covers the pull request's four
# lanes with one slot for a fan-out child, and the nightly's eight lanes
# still queue three deep until the working set at five is measured and the
# eval install's memory limit is raised together with the cap (the CR patch
# hack/kind-up.sh makes after helm is the shape; #2032 carries the
# measurement). Set on this install only, so the production default stays
# where the CRD reference argues it should. tests/test_ci_deploy_kanban_cap.py

#     otherwise run that job in next mode, recording and publishing nothing,
#     so main's window and dashboard would silently miss it), and refuses a
#     fan-out the bridge cannot be given as its concurrency, before anything
#     is built;
#   - step 4 also builds the A2A gateway, auth callout, worker and console
#     images from a2a/Dockerfile.* (the pull request's own builds, the same
#     way the four images above are; the operator would derive these same
#     references from its own image, and step 5 names them anyway so the
#     deploy's inputs are explicit) and the Hermes bridge sidecar image, FROM
#     the platform-agent image of the same build;
#   - step 5 passes those references to the operator through the chart's
#     operator.extraEnv, which the operator reads as its image overrides,
#     with the bridge's concurrency and executor pin beside them, and arms
#     the gateway's inject door the same way (A2A_INJECT_BACKEND=true);
#   - step 6b patches the CR (the mode, and the maxSessions section 2b sized
#     for the bridge's workers), waits for the agent Deployment to roll, gates
#     on the NATS StatefulSet, the callout Deployment, the provisioning Job
#     and the agent Deployment, in that order, waits

# Artifact Registry and install those. Set, it is the release-candidate eval —
# the candidate's images are already published, so there is nothing to build and
# rebuilding would measure a different artefact than the one being released.
#
# hack/resolve-rc-target.sh produces the value and documents why the caller, not
# this script, checks the tree out at that commit.
#
# The two paths differ in registry AND in image name: Artifact Registry carries
# `kube-agents-operator`, the published one is `k8s-operator`. That is why the
# RC path drops the repository overrides rather than rewriting them — the chart
# already defaults every image to the published GHCR path, so only the tag has
# to be said. The same drop is what carries the credential-proxy sidecar across:
# it is not a chart value at all, the operator derives it from the agent image by
# rewriting the trailing path element and keeping the tag
# (resolveCredentialProxyImage in k8s-operator/internal/controller/
# platformagent_manifests.go), so it follows whichever repository the agent uses

# ─── 2b. GitOps Repository for This Run ───────────────────────────────────────
# Every GitHub-writing eval scenario begins by reading the registered repositories
# out of the gitops-state ConfigMap — the fleet-audit streams do it in `audit_report.py
# start`, before anything else happens. The operator seeds that entry from
# spec.integration.github.gitRepo on the PlatformAgent CR; with the field unset
# no repository is registered and those scenarios stop at step 0 with nothing to clone.
#
# CI supplies the value and deliberately does NOT lean on the chart default.
# On the presubmit path everything this job deploys — chart, operator, agent —
# is built from the pull request, so a PR that blanks
# `platformAgent.integration.github.gitRepo` in values.yaml, or breaks the
# CR-to-ConfigMap seeding, is precisely the regression the eval should catch
# as a failed scenario. It can only catch it if the value the run is supposed to
# use arrives from outside the artefacts under test. The release-candidate path
# installs published images instead of built ones, which narrows what is under
# test without changing this argument: the chart still comes from the checkout,
# and supplying the value from outside is what keeps either artefact from
# choosing it. Note this is a *correctness* argument, not the containment
# boundary: what a run can actually write to is fixed by which repositories the
# GitHub App is installed on, which no PR can change. See
# docs/ci-pool-projects.md.
#
# One GitOps repo per leasable project, so two concurrent leases can never
# share a ledger issue or race on a remediation branch. Onboarding a further
# project (issue #637, Boskos leasing) is one line here, its row in
# gitlab_project_for_project() below, and the same pair in _EXPECTED_MAPPING in
# tests/test_ci_gitops_repo.py — no other edit in this file.
#
# A mapping here is a claim that the repo exists and that App 4675512 is
# installed on it. It is not self-verifying: with the line present and either
# of those missing, the deploy succeeds and every GitHub-writing scenario
# fails at `audit_report.py start` with a clone or token error instead of the
# named, actionable refusal below. Add the row when the repo and the
# installation are real, not when the project joins the Boskos pool — the two
# are separate events, and kube-agents-evals-3 is what happens when they are
# assumed to be one.

# deploy ahead of it, and a project whose reader cannot be impersonated should
# fail in seconds instead. Failing here usually also keeps the run inside the
# dashboard's setup-death bound -- a zero-task FAILURE under five minutes of
# whole job, scripts/eval_dashboard/classify.py -- so the health bot counts it
# as infrastructure and points at the leased project; a run that waited longer
# than that for its Boskos lease reads as a deploy break instead. A laptop
# fails the same gate for a different reason -- roles/owner cannot impersonate
# the reader -- and the gate's own message tells the two apart, naming the
# pool repair to a job and FLEET_ALLOW_RUNNER_CREDENTIAL=1 (which leaves the
# reader unset and passes on the developer's own credential) to a developer;
# this caller adds no repair of its own. Like EVAL_GITOPS_REPO above, that

# release-candidate path that makes the checkout load-bearing: the images come
# from RC_COMMIT_SHA and the chart, CRDs and eval tasks come from whatever tree
# this runs in, so the caller has to have checked the tree out at that commit
# first or the run grades the candidate's images against another revision's
# everything-else. hack/resolve-rc-target.sh is where that contract is written
# down, and .github/workflows/deploy-environment.yml is the existing precedent
# for honouring it with a checkout step.
# Webhooks stay at the chart's default (off): a PR evaluation cluster carries
# no cert-manager, and admission-webhook coverage belongs to the operator's
# own test suite rather than this smoke pipeline.
#
# runtimeClassName is pinned empty rather than left at the chart's default,
# which is `gvisor`. Step 7 reaches the agent over `kubectl port-forward`, and
# that does not work against a sandboxed pod -- the forward is set up in the
# host-side CNI netns while the listener lives in the sandbox's own network
# stack, so the connection is refused
# (docs/site/src/content/docs/operator/platformagent-crd.md is canonical on
# this; scripts/exec_tunnel.py is the relay that reaches one instead, as
# tests/e2e does). On a pool cluster with no `gvisor` RuntimeClass the pod
# would not schedule at all. Either way this job wants the standard runtime;
# what the sandbox does to the agent is the release pipeline's to exercise,
# not a smoke test's.

# was killed mid-uninstall — the cause no teardown-side fallback can cover.
# `helm upgrade --install` below then takes the upgrade path and dies with

# (A release stuck `pending-upgrade` *above* a deployed revision is a different state —
# upgrade then fails on Helm's in-progress lock, but that run's own teardown
# uninstall clears it, so it burns one run rather than poisoning the pool.)
#
# The probe is `helm history -o json` because it reads the same store the
# failing code path reads: Helm's upgrade errors in Releases.Deployed()
# (pkg/action/upgrade.go) when no release-record Secret carries status
# "deployed", and `helm history` lists exactly those record Secrets with
# their statuses. "History succeeds but no revision is deployed" is
# therefore precisely the state upgrade rejects — including a latest-failed
# release with an older deployed revision, which upgrades fine and is left
# alone. One call (or bounded re-probes if the probe hits a transient control-plane error);
# a healthy or absent release costs the probe and nothing more.

# ─── 6b. EVAL_MODE_NEXT: switch to spec.mode: next and gate the bus ──────────
# Everything above proved the today-mode install. From here the CR is patched
# and the gates run over what `mode: next` adds, in dependency order: the NATS
# StatefulSet (the bus), the callout Deployment (the Job below cannot
# authenticate to NATS without it), the provisioning Job (the streams; until
# it completes there is nothing on the bus), and then the agent Deployment,
# which the operator rolls when it pins the mode into the managed .env and
# the config hash moves. The Deployment's generation is recorded before the
# patch: `rollout status` right after it would answer for the today
# ReplicaSet, before the operator has reconciled anything.
#
# Then the door and the executor, which the eval's transport needs and the
# mode alone does not give it. The inject door's Service and token Secret are
# waited for (the operator renders them only with the flag step 5 set on it;
# hack/ci-eval-pr.sh reads that Secret). The bridge sidecar is the
# operator's: it budgets it from the first next render and adds it to the
# agent pod once the bus is provisioned, with the image, BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY
# and executor pin step 5 set on it
# (a2a/docs/hermes-bridge.md, "Where it runs"), so the mode patch is the only
# patch and the first provisioning Job already budgets the bridge's workers:
# no second render re-measures that budget against the stream the Job
# created, so the refusal #2077 guarded against cannot arise. The bridge
# enters the agent pod only once the bus is provisioned (BusProvisioned), so
# the agent Deployment rolls twice: once for the mode patch and once, after
# the Job, for the bridge. The step gates both rolls. Then the step ends on the bridge's own word that it is
# consuming `platform` tasks; until then the bus has an executor for nobody
# and every case on the inject transport ends as infrastructure. A rendered
# bridge leaves with the mode, so a flip back to today needs no CR edit for
# it; the one flip back the lane makes is hack/rollback-roundtrip.sh, after
# the matrix.
#
# The verifier is gated too, and gated LAST of everything here, which is not
# where its dependency would put it. Its precondition is the provisioning Job
# -- it binds the capability bucket at boot and exits when it cannot, so until
# the Job has created the bucket it crash-loops -- but its deadline is the
# first submission, which is hack/ci-eval-pr.sh, after this step. Waiting on
# it right after the Job would put a kubelet restart backoff of up to five
# minutes AHEAD of the agent rollout and the bridge's start, and so add that
# backoff to the deploy; waiting on it at the end spends the same backoff
# alongside the agent rollout and the bridge coming up, and still answers
# the only question that matters, which is whether the verifier is answering
# before anything asks it. Gated rather than reported because every executor
# turns an unanswered Check into a terminal rejection: a verifier still in
# backoff when the eval starts does not slow a case down, it refuses it, and
# the whole eval reads as a broken product (the same reason the slice pins
# A2A_VERIFIER_IMAGE through operator.extraEnv at all).
#
# Reported, not gated: the A2A gateway Deployment. It used to exit on start
# without a chat backend (#1660); the inject door is one, so it now starts,
# but no pool-project run has shown it coming up yet and a gateway that is
# down is what the harness classifies as infrastructure on every case rather
# than a deploy failure. Gating it is the change that follows the first
# measured run through the door. Not gated either: the shell StatefulSet,
# which does not change under next.
#
# Every A2A pod the operator renders carries CPU and memory requests and
# limits (#1700), so a namespace ResourceQuota on limits.cpu admits them;
# nothing this deploy or the chart renders carries such a quota either way.

# Reads the CR's phase and Ready condition, in one read, after a provisioning
# Job completed and stops the deploy on a refusal the Job's own conditions did
# not show: phase Degraded, or Ready carrying the reason a refused provision is
# given. Step 6b does not call it since the operator renders the bridge
# (#2592): the one provision Job already counts the bridge's workers, so no
# later render can be refused. It is kept, with its tests, for a step that
# re-renders the Job again.
# A refusal is already written when the Job is done, not a lag, so it fails
# on the first read that answers, and so does every other Degraded but one: a
# pod waiting for CPU or memory (CR_READY_REASON_POD_UNSCHEDULABLE with a
# count matching SCHEDULER_CAPACITY_SHORTFALL_RE), which an Autopilot scale-up
# clears on its own (#2414). That one is re-read up to
# MODE_NEXT_UNSCHEDULABLE_ATTEMPTS times, with a line per read, and fails as
# any other Degraded does if it is still there at the end or turns into
# something else. When the condition is about an agent pod, every read that
# returns it, the first and the last included, also reads the agent's pods,
# in one read, and a live pod bound to a node (the one the condition names,
# while it is listed) ends the gate as a hand-off to the
# agent Deployment's rollout gate that follows it, because the condition can
# outlive the wait it describes (the window's constant says why). A read
# that returns nothing, the first read included, is one more re-read against
# that window, never a pass: the read swallows a failed GET, and the CR
# carries a status once its provisioning Job has run, so nothing read is no
# answer. A window that ends with no read answering
# fails as a CR that could not be read. Prints the condition either way, so
# the artifact says what the CR said.
