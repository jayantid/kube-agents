The Platform Agent (Hermes) Deployment exports OpenTelemetry traces and, from its `agent-api-auth` sidecar, the event watcher's Prometheus metrics, and the credential-proxy Pod exports the broker's; LiteLLM and vLLM export both OpenTelemetry traces and Prometheus metrics to GKE Managed telemetry, and the Hindsight memory API exports Prometheus metrics. Container logs go to Cloud Logging. The Platform Agent's persona also generates Cloud Console links inline in Chat replies whenever it's discussing telemetry.

## What gets exported

### Prometheus metrics

- **LiteLLM** — request latency, per-model token counts, error rates on its `/metrics` endpoint (port 8080). Scraped by GKE Managed Prometheus via the `litellm-monitoring` `PodMonitoring` shipped in the LiteLLM integration base (`k8s-operator/config/integrations/litellm/base/podmonitoring.yaml`).
- **vLLM** — per-request latency histograms, queue depth, and GPU/KV-cache stats when running local models on GPU node pools. Exposed on its own `/metrics` endpoint and scraped by GKE Managed Prometheus.
- **Hindsight** — the Planning Agent's memory store. Retrieval and reranking latency (`hindsight_operation_duration_seconds`), HTTP request counts and durations, database pool wait times, and the token spend of its own extraction and consolidation calls (`hindsight_llm_*`, which bill through LiteLLM). Served on the API's ordinary HTTP port (8888), not a separate metrics listener, and scraped via the `hindsight-monitoring` `PodMonitoring` in `k8s-operator/config/integrations/hindsight/podmonitoring.yaml`. Recall latency is dominated by the reranker, so `hindsight_operation_duration_seconds` is the signal to watch — see [`docs/designs/memory.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/docs/designs/memory.md) for why. The Postgres StatefulSet exports nothing; the `pgvector/pgvector` image ships no exporter.
- **Event watcher** — per watched cluster: events seen, filtered, injected and deduplicated, inject errors, session creates, active incidents, and `k8s_event_watcher_cluster_up`, the one series that says events are flowing from that cluster. Served by the `k8s-event-watcher` in the gateway pod's `agent-api-auth` sidecar on port 9095 (container port `event-metrics`) and scraped by the `<name>-gateway-monitoring` `PodMonitoring` the chart renders where the cluster serves the `PodMonitoring` API; `platformAgent.podMonitoring`, `null` by default, forces it on or off. The operator's gateway NetworkPolicy admits the managed collector on that port. In Cloud Monitoring the collector's own `cluster` and `location` labels take precedence, so the watcher's arrive as `exported_cluster` and `exported_location`. The watcher's [README](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/cmd/k8s-event-watcher/README.md) says which series to alert on and how.
- **Credential broker** — every command the sandbox's wrappers send to the broker's exec route, as `kubeagents_tool_invocations_total{tool,subcommand,status}`, where `status` is `success` (exit 0), `error` (a non-zero exit, a rejected request, or a broker fault), `blocked` (a policy refusal), `busy` (the broker's command slots stayed full for the whole wait, so it never started) or `abandoned` (the caller hung up while its command was queued or running; a running one was killed); `kubeagents_tool_execution_duration_seconds{tool}`, a histogram from 50ms to 60s over the commands that ran; and `kubeagents_credential_proxy_requests_total{endpoint,status_code}` for the credentialed listener's traffic by route family. The `git` the broker runs itself for its version-control and workspace routes is not a tool invocation and is not counted here. Served on a metrics-only listener, port 8766 (container port `cred-metrics`), separate from the credentialed port so the collector is admitted to counters and nothing else, and scraped by the `<name>-credential-proxy-monitoring` `PodMonitoring` behind the same `platformAgent.podMonitoring` switch. Every label value is a static enum or a word from a closed vocabulary — for `kubectl` the policy's read verbs plus the write verbs a refusal is counted under, for `gcloud` the command groups the policy reads plus the few a refusal is counted under (a `gcloud` command is labelled by its group, `container` or `iam`, never by a verb), for `git` and `gh` the broker's own lists — so nothing a caller sends reaches a series: an unlisted verb or an unserved executable counts under `other`.

The Platform Agent (Hermes) container itself exposes no Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint — it serves only the API (`8642`) and Dashboard (`9119`) ports. Its runtime signals surface as OpenTelemetry traces (below) and `tool_call_audit` log records; pod-level CPU/memory is available through the Kubernetes metrics API (`kubectl top`). The metrics the gateway pod does serve are the event watcher's, above.

### OpenTelemetry traces

- **LiteLLM** and **vLLM** export spans directly to the GKE OTel collector (`gke-managed-otel` namespace). That collector is the default, not a requirement — see [Deploy → Telemetry](/kube-agents/deploy/telemetry/#pointing-at-your-own-collector) for pointing the deploy at your own.
- **Hermes** exports session, tool-call, and MCP spans via the `hermes_otel` plugin, enabled in every profile config (`agents/chat/config.yaml` for the Planning Agent, `agents/platform/config.yaml` for the Platform Agent, and the `agents/cluster/config.yaml` template for the per-cluster Cluster Agents).
- Traces route to Google Cloud Trace.
- All of this assumes a collector. On a cluster that has none, the operator disables the agent's exporter rather than pointing it at one that is not there — `status.telemetry.otlpEndpointSource` reads `None`, and export resumes on its own within 15 minutes of a collector appearing. See [Deploy → Telemetry](/kube-agents/deploy/telemetry/#pointing-at-your-own-collector).

### Cloud Logging

All container `stdout`/`stderr` is ingested by Cloud Logging by the GKE log agent. Cluster and pod labels flow through automatically. The Platform Agent writes its own logs to files under `/opt/data/logs/*.log`; a `fluent-bit` sidecar tails that shared volume and streams the lines to stdout so they reach Cloud Logging alongside every other container.

**Nothing in the `envoy-credential-proxy` container may log credential material.** That container, in the credential-proxy Pod, is the one place holding cluster credentials, GCP tokens, and chat secrets, and everything it writes to stdout leaves the cluster through the path above. The same rule covers the event watcher and the drift detector, which both run in the gateway Pod's `agent-api-auth` sidecar: they log identifiers — cluster, namespace, pod, event reason, profile directory, and for the detector the principal and resource name a change names — and never a token, a kubeconfig body, or a request header.

The broker records two bodies. One is the stdout and stderr of its start-up shell bootstrap when that command fails, truncated but not redacted. The other is the GitHub refresh helper's stderr, because a broker that refuses a mint is otherwise recorded nowhere — the caller gets a reason code with no detail, and the reason code is all a chat room ever sees; that text is passed through a redactor that blanks GitHub token and JWT shapes before it is logged. The rules the code follows to keep it that way are in [`docs/credential-isolation-design.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/docs/credential-isolation-design.md#logging).

## Session metadata plumbing

Every Chat message carries session context (space ID, user, thread) that flows through Hermes as OpenTelemetry span attributes and out to Cloud Trace. The `session_store` and `session_otel_bridge` plugins that do this run on the Planning Agent profile, which owns chat ingress. The trace is documented in [`docs/designs/gchat-session-metadata-data-flow.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/docs/designs/gchat-session-metadata-data-flow.md).

## Inline Console links

`SOUL.md §5` requires the agent, whenever it's discussing telemetry, tracing, logs, or debugging, to generate clickable Cloud Console links using the active project ID. The URL templates live in [`agents/platform/docs/gcp-console-links.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/agents/platform/docs/gcp-console-links.md) — a shared runtime reference baked into the agent image at `/opt/defaults/docs/` — covering Logs Explorer, Trace Explorer, Metrics Explorer, and the GKE Workloads console. The agent substitutes the runtime project ID and formats the links as Markdown so they render clickable in Chat.

## Auditing the agent itself

The [`kube-agents-observability` skill](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/agents/platform/skills/kube-agents-observability) audits the harness's own telemetry — logs, traces, metrics, API/dashboard observability of the Platform Agent. Use it when triaging "why did the agent do X?" or "why isn't the agent responding?".

## Tool-call audit

The `tool_call_audit` plugin (enabled on the Planning Agent and Platform Agent profiles; Cluster Agent profiles enable only `hermes_otel`) writes per-tool-call records for every skill invocation and MCP tool call. These flow through the standard log pipeline and are queryable in Logs Explorer.
