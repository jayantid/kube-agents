The `k8s-operator` is a Kubernetes controller that turns a `PlatformAgent` custom resource into a running Platform Agent Deployment plus everything it needs — Service, ServiceAccount, RBAC, PersistentVolumeClaims, and ConfigMaps for the agent config and logging. It also runs mutating (defaulting) and validating admission webhooks for the `PlatformAgent` type (see [Admission webhooks](#admission-webhooks)).

## What the operator manages

Custom resources in the `kubeagents.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1` API group:

- **`PlatformAgent`** — declares a Platform Agent instance, container image, service account, chat integrations, and harness toggles.
- **`AgentPlugin`** — declares OCI plugin extensions, secret environment variables, and allowed configuration overrides targeted to a `PlatformAgent`.

The controller reconciles a `PlatformAgent` into:

- A `Deployment` (named `<name>-gateway`) for the Platform Agent, running the Hermes runtime with a Fluent Bit log-forwarding sidecar and an `agent-api-auth` sidecar that terminates the PlatformAgent API bearer key, runs the `k8s-event-watcher`, and runs the `drift-detector` where an install has enabled it. The gateway executes nothing the model wrote; which credentials it does hold, and why, are on [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/).
- A `StatefulSet` (named `<name>-shell`) and its `Service`, the shell sandbox: `sshd` on `2222`, the durable `/opt/data`, and the wrappers that stand in for `gcloud` and `kubectl`. This is the pod that runs model-authored commands, and its ServiceAccount carries no Workload Identity annotation.
- A `Deployment` (named `<name>-credential-proxy`), a `ClusterIP` `Service` on port `8765`, and a `NetworkPolicy` narrowing who may reach it (the sandbox and the gateway on `8765`; pods in `gke-gmp-system`, where the managed-Prometheus collector runs, and the operator's own pods on the metrics-only port `8766`) — the credential broker, which holds every credential in the install and executes the real CLIs on the sandbox's behalf. See [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/).
- A `Service` fronting the gateway `Deployment` (API port `8642`, plus dashboard port `9119` when the dashboard is enabled).
- A `PodDisruptionBudget` selecting the Deployment's pods, `maxUnavailable: 1` at every replica count. That declares the agent evictable rather than blocking node drains, and it stays correct when the agent is scaled — a budget keyed to the replica count would deadlock drains the first time someone scaled back to one.
- A `ServiceAccount` (annotated for Workload Identity) plus RBAC — a viewer `ClusterRoleBinding` and an "explorer" `ClusterRole` with its own `ClusterRoleBinding`.
- `PersistentVolumeClaim`s for the agent's data and system metadata.
- `ConfigMap`s for the pod: config overlays merged into each Hermes profile's `config.yaml` at startup (including the whole rendered config for the default, Planning Agent, profile — see [how config reaches each profile](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/#how-config-reaches-each-profile)), a `SETTINGS.md` (GKE scope) mounted into `/opt/data/`, the [`spec.scope`](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/#specscope) declaration as `scope.json` mounted at `/etc/kube-agents/`, and a Fluent Bit config for the logging sidecar. Each profile's base config is baked into the image and scaffolded at startup.
- A `ConfigMap` (named `<name>-usage-counters`) holding the totals and per-pod baseline behind `status.usage`'s counters, owned by the CR, so it is collected with it, and written outside the reconcile loop; the operator writes it on the leader, at most once per five-minute poll, when a total or the per-pod baseline changed; a quiet poll writes nothing.
- Optional integrations wired through the CR `spec.integration` block: Google Chat (Pub/Sub topic/subscription), Slack (bot/app token secret refs), and version control (`forges` and the `repositories` on them — GitOps, managed and read-only context — with `github` as a deprecated alias).
- Under the unsupported `spec.mode: next` dev toggle, additionally the A2A playground stack (NATS, bus provisioning, the auth callout, the capability verifier and, once a chat backend is configured, the A2A gateway) — see the [PlatformAgent CRD page](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/) for what it renders.

## Custom resource shape

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeagents.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: PlatformAgent
metadata:
  name: platformagent
  namespace: kubeagents-system
spec:
  harness:
    clusterName: cluster-a
    location: us-central1-a
    projectId: example-project
    hermes:
      dashboardEnabled: true
      pluginsDebug: false
      apiServerSecretRef:
        name: platformagent-secrets
        key: api-key
  deployment:
    # Image is optional and omitted here on purpose. Omit it to use the
    # operator's default image (its PLATFORM_AGENT_IMAGE env var for
    # private-registry installs, else the public ghcr.io image; see the Docker
    # images page). Set it only to pin an image/registry for this agent:
    #   image: registry.example.com/kube-agents/platform-agent
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  security:
    serviceAccountName: kubeagents-platform-agent
    serviceAccountAnnotations:
      iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: kubeagents-platform-gsa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  integration:
    googleChat:
      # subscription config...
```

`harness.clusterName`, `harness.location`, and `harness.projectId` are all required. The credential
proxy only bootstraps a kubectl context when it has the complete triple; leave any one out and every
`kubectl` call the agent makes resolves to `localhost:8080` instead of a cluster.

## Admission webhooks

The manager serves a mutating (defaulting) and a validating webhook for `PlatformAgent`. The
Kustomize install registers them with `failurePolicy: Fail`. The Helm chart leaves them off by
default (`operator.webhooks.enabled=false`, because the chart cannot install the cert-manager they
need) and registers them at `operator.webhooks.failurePolicy`, which defaults to `Ignore`. The
Terraform full-install composition turns them on, since `enable_webhooks` defaults to `true`
there. So on a supported install the webhooks are registered — but under `Ignore` an unreachable
one admits the object with validation skipped rather than failing the apply, and on a fresh
full-install that is the first `PlatformAgent` rather than an edge case: Helm applies the webhook
configurations ahead of the cert-manager `Certificate` and the CR in the same release, which is
why the default is `Ignore` at all. Setting it to `Fail` is supported and documented (see the
[chart README](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/charts/kube-agents/README.md)).
Controls that must hold regardless are enforced in the render as well as at admission.

**The webhook server listens on port `10250`, not Kubebuilder's usual `9443`.** GKE creates one
firewall rule from the control plane to the nodes, and it permits only `tcp:443` and `tcp:10250`. The
API server dials the endpoint pod IP on the Service's `targetPort`, so on a private cluster a webhook
on any other port is unreachable until someone adds a VPC firewall rule for it — per cluster, by
hand. Serving on 10250 lands inside the rule GKE already made. It does not collide with the kubelet,
which binds 10250 on the node IP in a different network namespace.

The port is set in three places that must agree, and a test under `make test` fails if they drift: the
`--webhook-port` flag default in the webhook package, the manager `containerPort`, and the Service
`targetPort`. The Service `port` stays `443` regardless — that is what the `*WebhookConfiguration`
`clientConfig` resolves to, not what crosses the network.

### Serving on a different port

On a cluster where 10250 is not the reachable port — one that scopes GKE's rule to node IPs, or a
non-GKE cluster with its own constraints — **moving `--webhook-port` on its own wedges the cluster.**
The flag moves only the listener; the Service keeps sending the API server to 10250, nothing answers,
and `failurePolicy: Fail` blocks every `PlatformAgent` write. That is the outage this port change
exists to prevent, reached from the other side.

All three have to move together, so the override is a Kustomize patch rather than a flag:

```yaml
# config/webhook-port-patch.yaml, referenced from your overlay's `patches:`
- target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: controller-manager
  patch: |
    - op: add
      path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-
      value: --webhook-port=8443
    - op: replace
      path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/ports/1/containerPort
      value: 8443
- target:
    kind: Service
    name: webhook-service
  patch: |
    - op: replace
      path: /spec/ports/0/targetPort
      value: 8443
```

Changing the compiled-in default instead of patching means changing the flag default in the webhook
package as well — the test reads both manifests and fails if either still names the old
port. `--webhook-port` rejects anything outside 1–65535 at startup rather than letting
controller-runtime fall back to its own 9443 default.

### Upgrading from an operator that served 9443

Re-apply the manifests; do not bump the image alone. `targetPort` lives in the Service, so a
`kubectl set image` — or any pipeline that rolls the tag without re-applying `config/webhook/` —
leaves the Service pointing at 9443 while the new pod listens on 10250, which is the wedge described
below. `make deploy IMG=$IMG` applies both.

Applying both together still leaves a short window: the Service starts sending traffic to 10250 the
moment it is applied, and the old pod does not answer there. Any `PlatformAgent` write in the gap
between the Service change and the new pod becoming Ready fails closed. It is seconds on a healthy
rollout, but schedule the upgrade accordingly rather than alongside a `PlatformAgent` change.

**If the API server cannot reach the webhook**, `failurePolicy: Fail` means every `PlatformAgent`
create, update, and delete fails with a timeout — including the edits you would use to fix it. Errors
read `context deadline exceeded` or `failed calling webhook`. To recover, and to roll back a bad
webhook deployment:

```bash
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration kubeagents-validating-webhook-configuration
kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration kubeagents-mutating-webhook-configuration
kubectl -n kubeagents-system set env deploy/kubeagents-controller-manager ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false
```

That leaves the cluster with the validation coverage a chart install with
`operator.webhooks.enabled=false` has. The CRD's own schema and CEL rules still run -- those
belong to the API server, not to the webhook -- as does whatever the render enforces on its own.
What goes away is everything the operator's admission checks add on top, the bus-credential
refusals among them. Re-apply with `make deploy IMG=$IMG` once the cause is fixed.

## An image ahead of its ClusterRole

The webhook port above is one instance of a general skew: `make deploy` ships the ClusterRole with
the image, and only when it is re-run. A controller deployed from a floating tag such as `:latest`
is upgraded on its next pod reschedule while the applied ClusterRole stays put, and the first verb
the newer controller needs that the older role lacks fails every reconcile with `forbidden`.
Two things say so.

`make deploy` refuses an `IMG` whose tag is `latest`, `main`, `master`, `HEAD`, `dev`, or missing,
unless `ALLOW_MUTABLE_IMG=1` is set for a cluster that will be thrown away before its next
reschedule.

The controller checks its own permissions with `SelfSubjectAccessReview` when it starts and every
five minutes after, on its own ticker rather than on the reconcile worker. A denial is one
`RBAC self-check failed` line in the startup log naming the denied permissions
(`patch poddisruptionbudgets.policy`) and the fix, and a `Degraded` condition with reason
`RBACIncomplete` carrying the same text on each `PlatformAgent` it reconciles that is not already
`Degraded` for another reason. Reconciles continue; the steps that need the missing verb still fail
until the manifests are re-applied. Re-applying them with the same image tag restarts nothing and
triggers no reconcile, so the condition follows the next reconcile after the probe notices: every
five minutes while the condition stands and the reconcile completes, or, while the reconcile itself
is failing on the missing verb, on controller-runtime's retry backoff, which caps at about seventeen
minutes.
