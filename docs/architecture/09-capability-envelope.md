## TL;DR

Once agents are separate workloads a request crosses three or four hops between the human and the
action, and every hop is somewhere "who asked" can be dropped. This specifies an **attenuating
capability**: minted at ingress from the human's verified identity, narrowed at each hop, never
widened.

**No token format. Nothing signed. No key on the capability path.** The capability
lives in NATS KV and the message carries only a lookup id. Integrity comes from subject
permissions the server evaluates on every operation, fixed when the connection authenticates. Three rules make it hold: a
parent **names the one agent permitted to descend from it**, the verifier resolves an entry **only
for the agent it names**, and only that verifier may read the store. Revocation is deleting an
entry.

This is the **deferred hardening** already named in [03](03-security-model.md) §4a and
[08](08-agent-runtime-and-identity.md) §5, with a different mechanism.

## 0. What shipped, and what did not

Added 9/9, when the a2a plane armed this. Read it before treating any section below as either a
plan or a fact.

**Built and enforcing.** The `cap` bucket and its subject permissions; minting at ingress, so
`authority.grants` on a task submission is a real reference and no longer null; the chain walk with
its depth bound, visited set and revision pinning; both delegate rules; the verifier as its own
Deployment with the only read on the store; and the executor refusing a verb its capability does
not permit, as a terminal `rejected` event rather than a log line. The consumer rule in the payload
spec flipped for `authority.grants` on the strength of it.

**The per-request principal §4 and §5 both demand exists, and it was not new work.** The a2a chat
gateway (C20) allocates a session pod name and a taskId in the same breath at spawn; one incarnation
serves exactly one task; and the bus derives a pod's identity from the API server's attested
`authentication.kubernetes.io/pod-name` claim rather than from anything the pod says. So the
per-incarnation principal _is_ the per-request principal, the parent can predict its name because
the parent allocates it, and §5's "read the last five words of the claim as the target" is
discharged. That is a happier answer than §5 expected: it asked for a new credential-issuing
mechanism and the runtime already had one.

**Not built: the second hop.** §3 draws gateway → broker A → broker B, and the product has
gateway → session pod. There is no stage-3 dispatcher; the gateway's delegate flow spawns a
_successor_ session whose root the gateway mints itself, so it is hop 1 twice rather than hop 2.
Attenuation therefore ships as library, permission and verifier support with **no production
caller**, exercised by conformance tests and by a live probe holding two real session credentials.
A reader must not take the narrowing demonstration as evidence that a shipped component narrows.
Session pods deliberately hold no `$KV.cap.hop.<pod>.*` grant for the same reason: granting a
capability nothing uses is how a hole gets in ahead of the code that would have justified it.

**Not built, and still open: everything §5 lists.** Nothing expires. Revocation still names no
actor. The envelope still has no requester field. And the auth callout's signing seed is still the
largest concentration in the deployment - see the custody note at the end of §5, which is now
measured against a live install rather than asserted.

## 1. What this decides, and what it supersedes

**Those two sections stay canonical for the requirement.** [03](03-security-model.md) §4a is
explicit that v1 does **not** check the requester's own permissions, files per-request authority as
"Deferred hardening — user-scoped authorization", and points at
[08](08-agent-runtime-and-identity.md) §5. This document does not restate the requirement or the
trade; read them there.

What changes here is the **mechanism**. 03 §4a sketches it as `SubjectAccessReview` for Kubernetes
plus `testIamPermissions` / Policy Troubleshooter for GCP, with per-run downscoped tokens. The GCP
half was measured on a live cluster on 12 August 2026 and does not work:

- OAuth scopes do not constrain Kubernetes object operations -- a token minted `container.read-only`
  created a namespace.
- **No IAM Condition of any kind scopes a Kubernetes object operation.** Four spellings, four
  service accounts, one cluster, all refused, including
  `resource.service == "container.googleapis.com"`, which asserts nothing beyond "this is a GKE
  call". A conditioned binding is stored correctly, reported by Policy Troubleshooter as found and
  relevant, and grants nothing.

Generalising both: **GCP-layer credential attenuation does not reach Kubernetes object
authorization.** "Down-scope the agent's effective authority with per-run tokens" therefore has no
GCP mechanism behind it, and a Credential Access Boundary would not have rescued it either.

**This is the replacement for that half.** Attenuation moves into the envelope rather than the
credential, and the per-cluster credential becomes a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token minted by the
broker -- cluster-scoped by construction, because the issuer is the cluster. Where this and 08 §5
disagree on mechanism, this is the later measurement. Where they disagree on requirement, 03 §4a
wins.

**On invariant #3.** An earlier draft of this document argued that the invariant banned a transport
where what it protected was a property, and proposed restating it. That has happened -- #727
rewrote #3 as "agents coordinate through durable, attributable state -- never synchronous RPC",
with "no agent gains authority by being called" attached to it. So the argument this section used
to make is settled and does not need making again. What replaces it is the question the revised
invariant actually asks.

**The four-property test.** [02](02-agent-personas.md) section 2.3 says a new coordination
substrate must be durable, attributable, non-escalating and non-authoritative, and that meeting all
four is necessary rather than sufficient. Against that:

- **Durable.** The bus is durable with replay, and the capability chain is a second durable record,
  readable after the fact by anyone auditing. The store does not give append-only on its own -- see
  "every reference pins a revision" below -- so the audit value rests on that pinning, not on the
  bucket.
- **Attributable.** This is the property the document exists to carry, and as specified it does not
  fully carry it -- so read this bullet as the target rather than as a claim of conformance. The
  root is minted from the requester's verified identity and every hop descends from it, so the
  chain ties the work to one origin without a correlation exercise across logs. Two gaps, both in
  §5. The chain terminates at a request id and no entry holds a requester, so turning that origin
  into "which human" is still a lookup elsewhere, and `02` §2.3 asks for the human by name. And it
  is conditional on a request-scoped caller identity: where one identity serves several requests at
  once a resolution can attach to the wrong chain, and the walk then names the wrong origin
  confidently, which is worse than naming none.
- **Non-escalating.** Also this document, and the stronger claim: a message confers no authority
  because authority does not travel in the message at all. It travels in an entry the receiver
  cannot read, cannot widen, and cannot resolve unless it was named. Same condition -- "named"
  has to mean this request.
- **Non-authoritative.** Untouched by this design and not weakened by it. A capability bounds what a
  peer message may _ask for_; it says nothing about trusting the message content, which stays
  untrusted input under [03](03-security-model.md).

**The verifier is a synchronous call, and the invariant says never synchronous RPC.** Worth meeting
head-on rather than hoping nobody asks. What #3 forbids is agents coordinating by calling each
other -- one agent blocking on another's model output, with the call as the only record. The
verifier is neither an agent nor coordination. It is an authorization callout on the request path,
the same shape as the NATS auth callout 09 proposes alongside it, and it produces a decision about
an entry rather than work product from a peer. If that reading is wrong the design has a problem,
so it is stated here to be argued with rather than left implicit.

**Three components here did not exist in the design set, and 09 introduced all three.** The bus,
the per-agent broker in front of each agent, and the verification service were named throughout as
though they were furniture. **Resolved 9/9:** [05](05-system-architecture.md)'s inventory now
carries them as C16 (the bus), C18 (the session pod, which is the broker on the hop that exists)
and C19 (the verifier), alongside C17 for the auth callout -- four missing rather than three, which
is the sort of thing you find only by going to add one. **Amended 10/2: five, not four.** The
component that mints every entry in this document -- the a2a chat gateway, `a2a/gateway` -- was
missing too, and was the hardest of the set to see, because 05 already had a C15 called "ChatOps
gateway" and the word covered for it. They are two deployments: C15 is the Hermes runtime's chat
ingress and mints nothing; the minter is now C20. 05's "broker" (C6) is still the GitHub token
minter, a third thing wearing a shared word, so read every "the broker" below as this document's
sense of the word and not C6.

**What is settled and what is not.** The mechanism is agreed, and as of 9/9 the first hop is built
and enforcing -- section 0 says exactly what shipped and what did not. The multi-hop topology the
rest of this document presumes still does not exist, so everything below section 0 that describes a
second hop is a design rather than a description.

## 2. The recommendation, first

**No token format. Nothing signed. No key on the capability path.**

The capability lives in NATS KV. The message on the bus carries only a lookup id.

**"Key" below means a KV lookup key** -- a string like `root.req-8f2a` -- and never a
cryptographic key. No capability is signed, and nothing has to hold a key to mint or verify one.

**One cryptographic key does exist, and it is the most powerful thing in the design.** A NATS auth
callout answers each authorization request with a user JWT it signs with the issuer account's seed,
and that JWT carries the publish and subscribe permissions the server then enforces. So the seed
does not merely authenticate connections. It decides what every connection may do, including the
two permissions the whole integrity argument rests on: whoever holds it can issue itself a user
with publish on `$KV.cap.root.>` and read on `$KV.cap.>`, and then mint a root capability at any
tier and scope and read every capability in flight.

What the design avoids is narrower than "no keys", and it is still worth having: **no key on the
capability path**. Nothing mints, signs or verifies a capability, so no component needs a key in
order to participate in one, and there is no verification key to distribute to every hop. That is
the property §7's comparison turns on and it survives intact.

What it does not buy is immunity to key compromise, and an earlier version of this paragraph
claimed it did. The seed is the root of authority for the bus, so it wants gateway-grade custody, a
rotation story and a compromise runbook -- not the handling a credential described as
"authenticating connections" would get. §5 lists it with the other concentrations, and since 9/9
records what custody it **actually** has, measured against a live install: better than expected on
RBAC, worse on delivery and rotation, and now guarding strictly more than it did before this design
armed.

## 3. How it works

**Gateway.** Mints the capability, writes it to KV under key `root.<request-id>` -- subject
`$KV.cap.root.<request-id>`, the gateway's whole grant on this path -- and puts the id and the
revision the write returned, not the capability, into the message. The entry names the one
principal permitted to descend from it.

> **Corrected 9/9: the key does not repeat the bucket name.** Earlier drafts wrote the key as
> `cap.root.<request-id>`, which in bucket `cap` is the subject `$KV.cap.cap.root.<request-id>` --
> a subject §4's `$KV.cap.root.*` permission does not match, so the gateway could not mint at all.
> §4 was the correct half and the keys moved to meet it. Worth recording how it was found: the
> entire capability unit suite passed with the wrong spelling, attacker tests included, because
> not one of those tests crosses a subject permission. It took minting through the operator's real
> rendered `nats.conf` to see it. §4's own warning about key space versus subject space is about
> exactly this class, and the design tripped over it anyway.

**Broker.** Reads the id off the message and asks the verifier to resolve it. The agent behind it
sees neither the capability nor the store.

**Attenuation.** A hop that narrows writes a _new_ entry -- narrower capability, a pointer to its
parent pinned at the revision it resolved, and the next hop as its own delegate -- under its own
namespace, and passes the new id and revision downstream.

**Verification.** Six checks, all required. Authenticate the caller and confirm the entry it is
asking about names that caller as its delegate. Walk the chain to the root, refusing a chain that
revisits an entry or exceeds a fixed depth bound. Confirm the root sits under the `root.` prefix.
Confirm each link is narrower than its parent. Confirm **each link was written by the principal its
parent named as delegate**. Fetch every link **at the revision its referrer pinned**, and refuse if
that revision is no longer the one the store holds. Refuse otherwise.

**What the caller is told, and why it is less than the verifier knows** (9/9). Every one of those
six failures converges to a single answer -- "the capability does not authorize this caller" --
rather than to the specific check that fired. The distinctions the verifier can draw are exactly
the ones an attacker wants: whether a key exists, whether a pin is stale, whether a chain is deep
or cyclic, whether the refusal was the delegate rule or the walk. Verb and scope refusals are the
other way and keep their reasons, because those reach a legitimate caller holding a legitimate
capability who needs to know what it lacks. The split is deliberate: chain shape is not the
caller's business, and what a capability permits is.

The caller identity in the first check **must be request-scoped**. An identity shared across
concurrent requests cannot separate them, and the guarantee this design exists to make is void
without it. "The identity the verifier authenticates" below states what that requires of the
runtime.

The first is about the caller and the rest are about the chain, which is why an earlier draft had
only the chain ones. See "The subject prefix does not prove entitlement" below.

```
   gateway   writes  root.req-8f2a       = {tier: platform, scope: project/P,
                                            delegate: recon-7fb2}
                     └─ subject $KV.cap.root.req-8f2a
                     └─ the write returns revision 412
                     └─ message carries "root.req-8f2a @412"

   hop A     asks the verifier to resolve it over a2a.cap.verify.recon-7fb2, and is
             authenticated as recon-7fb2 by that subject -- the delegate the entry
             names, so it resolves and recon-7fb2 may descend
             writes  hop.recon-7fb2.1    = {tier: cluster-admin,
                                            scope: project/P/cluster/C,
                                            delegate: plat-a-31d9}
                                           parent: root.req-8f2a @412
                     └─ subject $KV.cap.hop.recon-7fb2.1
                     └─ message carries "hop.recon-7fb2.1 @418"

   hop B     resolves that as plat-a-31d9: chain narrows, and plat-a-31d9 is the
             delegate the entry names.  recon-7fb2 asking for the same id would be
             refused
             writes  hop.plat-a-31d9.7   = {tier: developer-team,
                                            scope: project/P/cluster/C/ns/web, ...}
                     └─ and so on
```

Three things in that diagram are 9/9 corrections rather than cosmetic. Keys no longer repeat the
bucket name, per the note above. **`delegate` holds a per-request principal, not an agent id** --
`recon-7fb2` is one incarnation serving one request, which is what makes the two delegate rules
separate anything (§5). And **scope is a `/`-segmented path**, because "narrower" needs a
containment relation and the old shorthand did not have one: `project-P` narrowing to `cluster-C`
had nothing linking the two, so a verifier could not tell containment from a sibling. Containment
is segment-prefix on that path, and a sibling scope is refused.

A hop delegating to several agents writes one child per recipient, each naming a single delegate.
A list would also work; one child per recipient keeps the audit trail exact about who was handed
what.

## 4. Why this needs no crypto

NATS KV keys live on subjects, and a client's subject permissions are **fixed when it
authenticates and evaluated by the server on every operation**. So, writing a bucket named `cap`:

- Only the gateway may publish under `$KV.cap.root.*`
- Each broker may publish only under `$KV.cap.hop.<its-own-principal>.*`
- **No broker may read the bucket at all.** Only the verification service holds read on
  `$KV.cap.>` and on the JetStream API subjects that return a capability. Two principals hold a
  carve-out, stated here rather than discovered. The rendered provisioning Job authenticates as
  `provision`, through the callout -- not as `seed`, which it moved off -- and the hand-applied
  `seed` tooling beside it is the static twin; each holds `$JS.API.STREAM.CREATE.KV_cap` and
  `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.KV_cap`, and nothing else on this path. Both verbs are the one guard:
  `kv info cap || kv add cap` needs `INFO` for the probe and `CREATE` for the `kv add` it falls
  through to. Neither returns an entry. `STREAM.INFO` returns stream state — a message count, a
  subject list, a first and last sequence; `STREAM.CREATE` against a bucket that already exists
  returns that stream's config unchanged, or fails outright if the config differs. Every subject
  that does return a capability stays refused for both as for everyone else, which is what makes
  it a carve-out and not a hole, and it is asserted as an allow in the conformance suite so that
  taking the grant away fails there instead of in an install.

> **The third bullet was false when it was first implemented, and it is worth knowing how** (9/9).
> The verifier's own grants were correct. The hole was on the other side: the gateway, the worker
> and the seed each held a broad `$JS.API.>` for the streams they legitimately provision and
> consume, and `$JS.API.>` contains `$JS.API.DIRECT.GET.KV_cap` and
> `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.KV_cap`. Three principals could read every capability in flight, with

> and walked straight into it. Closed by enumeration rather than by a `deny`: the allow lists

> split the enumerations across the workloads that had been sharing them, and #1672 took the
> gateway's, which was the last one left. `TestOnlyTheseIdentitiesHoldTheBareJetStreamAPIGrant`
> now pins the set of principals holding a bare `$JS.API.>` at empty.

**Writing a deny for a JetStream stream takes two wildcards, not one.** The stream name lands at
different depths depending on the API call -- `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.KV_cap` at depth 4,
`$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.KV_cap.<durable>` at depth 5 -- so a deny has to cover
`$JS.API.*.*.KV_cap` and `$JS.API.*.*.*.KV_cap` and their `.>` forms. Positional wildcards, matched
against the API's real shape, rather than one pattern that looks like it covers the space.

**And a permission block with a deny and no allow is a widening, not a narrowing.** NATS reads it
as everything-except-the-deny. So a renderer that emits `deny` lists must refuse to emit a block
whose allow list is empty; the failure is silent, it looks like tightening, and it hands the
principal the entire subject space.

**Spell these in subject space, not key space.** A KV key does not live at its bare name: bucket
`cap` is stream `KV_cap` on `$KV.cap.>`, and a get is a JetStream API call under `$JS.API.*` rather
than a subscribe on the key. A permission written as `cap.root.*` matches no subject any KV
operation touches, so it grants and denies nothing -- and a read denial written that way leaves a
broker holding broad `$JS.API.>` for any other stream with a working path to the store. The
denial tests inherit the same requirement: written against the bare names they pass on a server
where no `$KV` permission has been configured at all, which is the shape of test §9 opens by
warning about.

That buys the two properties a signature would have bought:

**Who wrote this link.** The subject prefix proves it. Forging a root capability means
publishing on a subject the server refuses you, with the permissions
it attached when you authenticated and cannot be talked out of afterwards.

**Did each link narrow.** The verifier reads parent and child and compares. A compromised broker
that writes something wider than it received is caught when the next hop resolves the chain.

The integrity comes from server-enforced permissions rather than from cryptography. Same guarantee,
and no key on the capability path to distribute -- with the one exception §2 names: the permissions
above are carried in the user JWT the auth callout signs, so the seed that signs it can grant
itself any of them. The refusal is the server's rather than our code's, which is what this section
claims; it is not independent of the seed.

**Every reference pins a revision.** A KV put on an existing key is an update rather than an error,
and a KV delete is itself a publish to the key's own subject -- so the one permission that lets a
broker create a link also lets it overwrite that link, or delete it and create it again, after the
link has been resolved and acted on. Either way the audit record is rewritable by the party it
exists to attest, and a subject permission cannot express "create but do not update", so the
permission model cannot close this on its own.

What closes it is that nothing refers to an entry by key alone. A write returns the revision it
landed at; whoever refers to that entry afterwards carries the revision with the key, and the
verifier fetches at that revision rather than fetching the latest. The message carries `id @rev`,
and a child's parent pointer carries its parent's `@rev`, so the chain is pinned end to end.

Both rewrite paths then fail the same way rather than needing separate detection. An overwrite moves
the entry to a new revision and the pinned one no longer resolves. A delete-and-recreate is worse
for the attacker, not better: the recreated entry lands at a fresh sequence, so every pin to the old
one dangles. This is deliberately not "check the entry is at its first revision" -- a revision is
the underlying stream's sequence and is bucket-wide, not per key, so an entry's first write carries
whatever number the bucket had reached and there is nothing for a verifier holding one entry to
compare against.

One consequence for anyone reading the store afterwards. A pin protects the _verifier_, which asks
for a specific revision and gets what the referrer intended or nothing. It does not protect a reader
who asks for a key and takes the latest value, and that is how an audit tool would naturally be
written. At the bucket's default of one revision per key the two agree, because an overwrite
discards what it replaced and the pin then dangles. Raise history above one and they diverge: the
pin still resolves to the intended content while the latest value at that key is whatever was
written last. **So audit reads follow the pins, by revision, rather than reading keys** -- which is
also the only reading that reconstructs the chain as it was resolved.

The cost is that a broker can still break its own descendants by deleting a link it wrote. That is
denial of service against a chain it is already inside, not a way to widen anything, and it is the
same delete authority §5 flags as unresolved for revocation.

**Say "the server refuses it", not "the connection is refused".** The two are different observables
and only one of them happens. A client with no publish right on `$KV.cap.root.*` connects fine and
authenticates fine; it gets `-ERR 'Permissions Violation for Publish to ...'` when it publishes, and
the connection stays open. The property §4 needs is intact -- the refusal comes from the server and
not from application code we have to write -- but a denial test worded as "the connect is rejected"
fails against a correctly configured server, and the natural repair is to weaken it to "the connect
succeeds", which asserts nothing at all.

### The subject prefix does not prove entitlement

Worth stating separately, because two drafts of this design got it wrong in two different places
and neither failure is obvious.

Write permission proves who wrote a child. It proves nothing about whether that writer ever
_received_ the parent the child names. Without a further rule, a compromised broker writes
`hop.<its-own-principal>.N` naming `parent: root.<somebody-else's-request>` -- a root minted for a
more privileged human -- and every check passes. The root is under the `root.` prefix, each link narrows,
and the prefix correctly proves who wrote the child. The hop has escalated by descending from
someone else's origin. Request ids are not secrets, so naming one is no barrier.

**Three rules close it, and all three are needed.**

**The parent names its delegate.** Every entry carries the single agent id permitted to write
children of it, and verification refuses a child whose writer is not that agent. Authority to
descend is granted by the parent's author and proved by the subject prefix, rather than inferred
from the child.

**The verifier authenticates its caller.** A resolution is refused unless the entry names the
caller as its delegate. The rule above closes descending from a root you were never handed. On its
own it does nothing about simply _presenting_ that root, which reaches the same authority with less
work. A broker puts `root.<somebody-else's-request>` on its outbound message and skips writing
a child entirely. Every chain check passes, and vacuously: a single-entry chain widens
nothing, and a root has no parent whose delegate could be violated. Same precondition as above --
ids are not secrets -- and the same escalation, on the read path.

One field does both jobs, one level apart. The writer of an entry must be the delegate its
_parent_ names; the resolver of an entry must be the delegate _it_ names. Both are the party that
was handed the id, which is the point.

### The identity the verifier authenticates

Both delegate rules are only as sharp as the identity they compare against, and an agent id is not
sharp enough. [02](02-agent-personas.md) fixes cardinality at one Cluster Admin Agent per cluster
and one Developer Team Agent per namespace, so a single agent id is the named delegate of every
request routed through it, for every human, at the same time. Check the rules against that and they
stop separating anything. A broker serving a developer-team-tier request presents the id of a
concurrent platform-tier one, is the named delegate of that entry too, and passes every check holding a
capability minted for someone else. No forged write and no second compromise -- and a concurrency
bug in an honest broker reaches the same place as a malicious one, which is the part that should
worry you.

**So the identity the verifier authenticates must be scoped to the request, not to the agent.** A
capability is per-request, and a check that compares it against a per-agent identity is comparing
against the wrong thing. This is a requirement 09 places on the runtime rather than something the
KV scheme can fix from inside: whatever issues the broker's credential must issue a distinct one
per request, so that "the caller" and "the request" are the same subject.

**~~Nothing in the design set provides that today~~ -- answered 9/9, and by something that was
already there.** The paragraph that stood here reasoned from agent-granularity identity: [08](08-agent-runtime-and-identity.md)
§5 holds a scope broker out of v1 and rules out "per-request credential enforcement" by name, and
[02](02-agent-personas.md) §8 and [06](06-api-and-data-contracts.md) §2 fix agent identity as one
pre-created, tier-scoped ServiceAccount per agent. All still true, and all about _agents_. The a2a
plane does not authorize agents. It authorizes **session pods**, and the shape it already had is
the shape this section asked for:

- The a2a chat gateway (C20) allocates the session pod's name and the taskId **in the same breath at
  spawn**, so the parent can predict the delegate's name -- which is precisely the derivability
  this section identified as the real obstacle, rather than the credential existing yet.
- **One incarnation serves exactly one task.** A session pod is spawned per task and reaped with
  it, so per-incarnation and per-request are the same partition, not an approximation of it.
- The bus derives a pod's principal from the API server's attested
  `authentication.kubernetes.io/pod-name` claim on its ServiceAccount token, so the identity is
  not something the pod asserts about itself.

So the per-request principal is the session pod name, and the requirement is met by a runtime
property rather than by the new credential-issuing component this section priced. The verifier
authenticates its caller the same way the task plane does: the caller publishes on
`a2a.cap.verify.<its-own-principal>`, the server refuses any principal publishing on another's
token, and the verifier reads the caller off the subject rather than off anything in the request.

**Two consequences worth stating.** A NATS message does not carry its publisher, so this only works
because the subject is the identity -- a design that put the caller in the request body would be
back to advisory bytes. And the reply subject has to be namespaced the same way: replies ride
`a2a.cap.reply.<caller>.*` rather than `_INBOX`, because under `_INBOX` the verifier's publish
grant would have to be `_INBOX.>`, which would let it forge JetStream API replies into any
principal's inbox -- including the gateway's. The verifier also drops any request whose reply
subject falls outside the caller's own reply namespace, since the reply-to is caller-chosen.

**Where the weaker guarantee still applies.** With a shared agent identity the bound would be the
widest capability concurrently delegated to that agent rather than the authority of the human whose
request is being served. That is what the a2a plane escapes. Any _future_ consumer of this design
running at agent granularity inherits the weaker bound, and the sentence in §5 is only true where a
per-request principal is.

**Only the verifier reads.** If every broker could walk the chain itself, every broker would need
read across `cap.*`, which is what makes other agents' roots discoverable in the first place.
Moving the walk into one service removes the need to distribute read at all. It does not by itself
remove discovery: every broker must be able to call the verifier, so without the caller check above
an id is still resolvable by anyone who can name one, and discovery has moved from a KV read to an
RPC rather than gone away. Withholding read and checking the caller are what close it between them.
The verifier sits on the request path, which is the same shape -- and the same
cost -- as the NATS auth callout 09 proposes alongside it.

**Revocation is deleting an entry**, which is the other reason to prefer this. A signed token is
valid until it expires no matter what you learn in the meantime.

**The cost** is a lookup on the request path and a dependency on the bus. If the bus is down
there are no messages to authorize, so that dependency is smaller than it first appears.

## 5. What this does not solve

Seven things, stated so nobody assumes otherwise. The last three are open questions rather than
accepted limits, and they go to the downscoping design discussion together.

**Attenuation is code.** A hop that forwards without narrowing is a hole, and no token format or
KV scheme fixes that. Real tension with "structural, not behavioural."

The bound that makes it survivable: a hop can only descend from a parent that named it, and every
chain terminates at a root the gateway minted for that one request.

> **A broken hop cannot exceed what it was delegated for the request it is serving.** Worst case is
> "narrowed less than intended", never "widened past the root minted for this request."

That is the sentence to have ready when someone probes the design, and it is worth knowing both what
carries it and what it does not say. It does not say "past the human who asked": the root is minted
from the gateway's own install-wide tier and scope, the same pair for every requester, and nothing
about who asked reaches the entry. §5's "the envelope has no requester field" below is the same fact
stated from the other side. What carries what the bound does say: the two delegate rules above, a
per-request principal both of them can name, and nothing else. The write half stops a hop descending from an origin it was never handed. The read
half stops it presenting that origin directly. The principal is what makes "it" mean this request
rather than this agent. It holds under imperfect implementation, which is the only kind there is,
but it does not hold under a missing rule.

**All three supports are now carried on the a2a plane** (9/9; this paragraph used to say the
opposite and the correction is the substantive one in this revision). Both delegate rules are
implemented and tested directly rather than through a correct hop, and the principal is the session
pod name -- see "The identity the verifier authenticates" above for why that is per-request rather
than per-agent, and why it needed no new component.

What made the old objection sharp is worth keeping, because it applies to any consumer of this
design that does _not_ have a per-request principal. The write side is proved by the subject
prefix; at agent granularity, an agent concurrently the delegate of two roots can write a child
descending from the wider one while serving the narrower one's request. The read side looks better
and is not: making the caller's credential per-request while `delegate` still holds an agent id
changes one side of a comparison whose other side is per-agent, so compare at agent granularity and
the escalation survives untouched, demand exact equality and no legitimate resolution matches at
all. **Both sides have to move together.** They did here: the caller is an incarnation and
`delegate` holds an incarnation.

**Both delegate rules are what carry the claim, so both are tested against directly.** A suite
built from well-formed capabilities exercises neither: a correct hop satisfies both rules
incidentally and would pass with either one deleted. The tests that matter are the two attacks --
a broker writing a child of a root that names somebody else, and a broker presenting a root it was
never handed -- and they were written before the verifier existed.

**Chain depth is a refusal, not just a cost.** Resolution walks to the root, so a long chain is a
lot of KV reads. Those are now the verifier's reads rather than every broker's, so caching them is
tempting. Be careful with it: a per-id cache invalidated only by revoking that id serves a stale
answer after an _ancestor_ is deleted, which is exactly the case §9's revocation test exercises, so
an implementation doing the obvious thing fails that test. A cache has to be invalidated by any
delete or overwrite anywhere in the chain, which means watching the bucket rather than reasoning
about the id in hand. Not a problem at three or four hops, so the honest advice is to leave it
uncached until it measures.

The reason the walk is bounded is the other one. A broker holds publish across
`$KV.cap.hop.<its-own-principal>.*`, so it can write two entries in its own namespace naming each other as
parent, each naming itself as delegate, with identical payloads. Every rule holds -- both writes
are inside its permitted subject, each entry's parent names it as delegate, and `C_new ⊆ C_old` is
satisfied by equality -- and the walk never reaches a terminal. One broker, using only the
permissions this design grants it, hangs the verifier. Since the verifier is a single service on
the request path and nothing authorizes while it is down, that is a fleet-wide outage from one
compromised or simply buggy hop. Hence the depth bound and the visited set in the checks above,
and the denial tests for both.

**The verifier is trusted and on the request path.** It is the only component holding read across
`$KV.cap.>`, so compromising it exposes every in-flight capability, and if it is down nothing
authorizes. That is a real concentration and it is the price of not distributing read.

Now that it ships, say the operational half plainly: **a verifier outage refuses every task**, and
it refuses them visibly, as `rejected` terminals rather than as a queue that drains later. It runs
two replicas with a surge-only rollout and is the third workload on the a2a plane, but two replicas
is availability engineering, not a different answer. An install that cannot tolerate that failure
mode wants the relax switch (`A2A_CAPABILITY_REQUIRED=false`), and that switch is a decision to run
without this control rather than a tuning knob. It is inverted in code so the enforcing behaviour is
the zero value: a config that fails to parse, or an env var nobody set, enforces.

**The auth callout's signing seed is a larger one.** It signs the user JWTs that carry the
permissions §4 relies on, so its holder can grant itself publish under `$KV.cap.root.>` and read
across the bucket -- mint a root at any tier, and read every capability in flight. Compromising the
verifier exposes what is in the store; compromising the seed lets you write to it as the gateway.
Neither is a reason not to do this, and both belong in the same tier of scrutiny, but the seed is
the one to write the custody and rotation story for first. It now has an object to write
that story about: the seed lives in Secret `<agent>-a2a-callout-keys`, read by the auth
callout Deployment and nothing else -- as an environment variable through a `secretKeyRef`,
not a volume; the Deployment has no volumes at all -- and deliberately not in the per-user
credentials Secret that several workloads read. `docs/designs/spec-nats-deployment.md` owns the
detail. Rotation is not a credential refresh: the public half is in `nats.conf`, and the
server refuses a config reload that touches the callout block at all, so rotating it is a
bus restart.

**Arming this design made that seed strictly more powerful, and the PR that armed it did not fix
the custody** (9/9). Before, forging a user JWT bought the bus. Now the same forgery buys the
capability store, and there is no crypto on the capability path to fall back on -- §4's whole claim
is that subject permissions _are_ the integrity control, and this key is what signs them. So the
one cryptographic key in a design that advertises no crypto is now also the capability system's
root of trust.

**What custody it actually has, measured rather than asserted.** Checked read-only against a live
install on 9/9, because "check what it has" and "read what the design says it has" turned out to
give different answers.

Three properties hold, and the middle one is the strongest:

- The seeds live in their own Secret, separate from the per-user NATS credentials the gateway, the
  session spawner and the agent pod all read.
- **No ServiceAccount in the namespace can read a Secret there except the operator's own** --
  confirmed by impersonated `auth can-i` per ServiceAccount, not from the RBAC manifests. Not the
  gateway, not the session pods, not the shell. None of them can `create pods/exec` either. The
  agent cannot reach this seed through the API server, which is the path that matters most.
- One consumer: a mount-and-env survey of every pod in the namespace found the Secret referenced
  only by the callout.

Three gaps stand open:

- **It is delivered as an environment variable rather than a projected file**, and the code comment
  claimed the opposite -- said "mounted", while the pod has no volumes at all. `secretKeyRef` does
  keep the value out of the pod spec and out of `describe`, so this is narrower than it first
  reads, but env is inherited by every child process and lands in core dumps. Neither the
  comment nor the delivery is fixed: `platformagent_a2a_calloutkeys.go` still says "mounted by
  the callout Deployment", and so does the env block in `platformagent_a2a_callout.go` ("the
  only thing that mounts them"). Both are code, so they are filed rather than carried here.
- **No application-layer secrets encryption.** The seed sits in etcd under disk encryption alone --
  no KMS envelope, no external secret store. "Gateway-grade custody" should mean at least the
  envelope.
- **No rotation story and no compromise runbook**, and the reason is structural rather than an
  oversight: rotation forces a NATS restart, because the server refuses a config reload that
  touches `auth_callout`. Combined with "nothing expires" below, a JWT an attacker minted before a
  rotation stays valid until its connection drops. There is no revocation of an issued user JWT.

**Nothing expires.** No entry carries an issue time, a use count, or any notion of the request
being over, and a TTL is rejected elsewhere in this document as a thing revocation saves us from. So
a root minted at 10:00 for a request that finished at 10:01 is still a valid parent at 03:00, and a
hop can write a fresh child of its own stale root and drive work attributed to a human who went
home. "For the request it is serving" is not observable to the mechanism as specified.

**Shipped unsolved, deliberately** (9/9). The bucket's history is one revision per key and nothing
sweeps it, so every capability ever minted is still resolvable. What limits the blast radius today
is only that the delegate is a session pod name and session pods are reaped: a stale root names a
principal that is usually not running, so usually nothing presents it. That is an accident of the
topology rather than a property of the design, and it stops being true the moment a delegate
outlives the request. Do not read it as expiry.

**And "nothing can present it" is the wrong strength** (10/2). The entry's `delegate` is the pod
name alone. The API server attests the pod UID too, and `a2a/authcallout` requires it to be
present, but the UID never enters the principal the name is checked against -- so a future pod
that happens to be minted with the same name satisfies the delegate check on every stale entry
naming it. Names are not reserved after a reap. `mintSessionName` builds
`<profile>-<animal>-<hex>` from a time-indexed pick out of eight animals and `randHex(4)`, which
is four random _bytes_ rendered as eight hex characters: 2^32 per animal, about 3.4x10^10 per
profile. A birthday argument puts the first repeat around 232,000 session names on that pool, or
around 82,000 if the animal is not counted as entropy -- it is derived from `UnixNano`, not drawn
randomly, so the conservative figure is the one to quote. Either is far out of reach of a normal
install and neither is a security property: a collision is not required for an attacker who can
influence which name gets minted, and the design has no statement about who can. The correct
reading is that reaping narrows the window, not that it closes it, and that binding `delegate` to
name-and-UID would close it.

**Decided 10/2: bind the UID.** It cannot be bound at mint, because the mint deliberately precedes
the spawn -- the entry must name the principal before that principal's credential exists, which is
the ordering §5 requires -- and a pod UID is the API server's to assign, so at mint time it does
not exist. The gateway already receives it and discards it: `Pods.Create` returns it on the created
object and the spawn path returns only the name. The shape this takes, then, is a write-back: mint
the entry naming the pod name, spawn, then write the attested UID into the entry, with the verifier
requiring UID-present before it accepts. That leaves one sub-question this document does not settle
-- what an entry that has a name and no UID yet is good for, in the window between the mint and the
write-back -- and that window needs a stated rule rather than an implied one. Tracked as #2282;
not this document's change to make, and not a change to the PR carrying it.

**Revocation names no actor.** Deleting an entry is a stated goal and nothing says who deletes. The
verifier holds read only, so it cannot. The gateway holds `$KV.cap.root.*`, so it can revoke roots
and nothing else. The only party that can delete a hop entry is the broker that wrote it, which is
the party being revoked from. **Shipped in that state**: no component deletes a capability, so
revocation -- the property this design prefers over TTLs, and the reason it can tolerate "nothing
expires" -- is the one advertised feature with no implementation behind it.

**The envelope has no requester field.** It carries a tier and a scope. [03](03-security-model.md)
§4a stays canonical for the requirement and that requirement is authorization against the
requester's own identity, which a hop cannot perform from a resolved capability because it does not
know who the human is. The goal below is written as "agent ceiling ∩ requester" while the mechanism
delivers agent ceiling ∩ tier, and the chain walk terminates at a request id rather than at a
person -- so "who asked" is still a lookup somewhere else. Which way to reconcile that is a
downscoping question, not one this document should settle alone.

---

## 6. Background: this pattern has a name

Everything above is an application of **macaroons**, and it is worth being able to say so.

> Birgisson, Politz, Erlingsson, Taly, Vrable, Lentczner. _Macaroons: Cookies with Contextual
> Caveats for Decentralized Authorization in the Cloud._ NDSS 2014.

A Google paper, which is convenient for the audience. The core idea is an authority token that
any holder can narrow by appending a caveat, and that nobody can widen. That is precisely the
C_new ⊆ C_old chain, and we should present it as applying a known pattern rather than as a scheme
we invented. Naming it first turns "did you two design your own crypto?" into "yes, that one."

**We are not using the macaroon construction itself**, and there is a specific reason worth
recording.

Macaroons chain with symmetric HMAC: `sig = HMAC(root_key, id)`, then `sig = HMAC(sig, caveat)`
for each caveat. Appending needs no key, which is the elegant part. But **verification requires
the root key** -- so every component that verifies also holds the key that mints.

In hub-and-spoke that means shipping a fleet-wide minting key to every broker in every spoke. One
compromised broker becomes a fleet-wide authority. Bad trade, and easy to walk into if someone
reads the citation and reaches for a library.

**The difference is copies, not kind, and the argument is weaker than it first reads.** The auth
callout's seed can mint too (§2), so this design also has a key whose holder gets fleet-wide
authority -- it has one copy of it, in one service, instead of one in every broker in every spoke.
That is a real and large difference in blast radius and it is the honest version of the claim. It
is not "we avoided the key".

**If we ever need self-contained tokens, use biscuit, not macaroons.** Same append-only
attenuation, built on Ed25519 rather than HMAC: verification needs only the root _public_ key, so
verifiers verify and cannot mint. <https://www.biscuitsec.org/>

The only scenario that would force this is a hop that must authorize without reaching the bus.
Nothing in the current topology needs that.

## 7. The general rule this came from

The same reasoning decided three separate questions:

Every cryptographic check we build is a key to custody, rotate, revoke and recover, plus a
verification path that can have a bug. A structural property has none of those. A token from
cluster C does not work against cluster D whether or not our code is correct today.

It is also why the RBAC-over-IAM measurement felt like a win rather than a setback. We went
looking for a way to _express_ per-cluster scope and found the scope was already structural one
layer down.

## 8. Goals & non-goals

### Goals

- Make **effective authority = agent ceiling ∩ requester** hold across process boundaries, not only
  inside one process.
- Carry it with **no key on the capability path** -- nothing mints, signs or verifies a capability,
  so no component needs a key to participate in one and there is no verification key to hand every
  hop. Not a claim of key-compromise immunity: the auth callout's account seed signs the JWTs that
  carry the bus permissions, so its holder can mint a root (§2, §5).
- **Revocation that takes effect now**, by deleting an entry, rather than waiting out a TTL.
- Give audit "who asked" directly, without a correlation step across hops.

### Non-goals

- **Not a replacement for the read-only ceiling or the PR gate** ([03](03-security-model.md) §1).
  This narrows authority within those bounds; it never widens anything and never creates a write
  path.
- **Not offline-capable.** A hop that must authorize without reaching the bus is out of scope --
  see the biscuit note above if that ever changes.
- **Not credential attenuation.** The envelope narrows what a request may ask for. The credential
  handed to the API server is a separate mechanism (a per-cluster ServiceAccount token, §1).
- **Not a defence against a compromised gateway.** The gateway is the root of trust for the whole
  chain; if it lies about who asked, everything below inherits the lie.
- **Not per-user granularity.** Capabilities carry the same `tier` the `Agent` CR does
  ([02](02-agent-personas.md) §6.1), so this is as fine-grained as that field and no finer.

## 9. Verification

Every check below asserts a **denial**. A test that only confirms an authorised request succeeds
cannot distinguish a working control from an absent one, and several of the failure modes here are
silent.

**All of these now exist** (9/9), and the split between them turned out to matter more than the
list did. The chain checks live in the capability package's own suite, written against an
in-process resolver. Four of them -- everything phrased as "the server refuses", the tenth through
thirteenth below -- live in the conformance suite, which starts a real `nats-server` from the config the operator actually renders
and connects as the rendered principals. That boundary is not bookkeeping: the whole unit suite,
attacker tests included, passed against a key scheme that made minting impossible, because not one
unit test crosses a subject permission. **A denial that names a subject has to be tested against a
server, and against the shipped render rather than a hand-written config.**

- **Descent without delegation is refused:** a broker writes a child naming a parent that names a
  _different_ agent as delegate. Resolution fails. This is one of the two checks that carry the
  "cannot exceed what it was delegated" claim; without it the design is broken, so it is the first
  test to write.
- **Resolving an id you were never handed is refused:** a broker asks the verifier to resolve an
  entry naming a different agent as delegate, and is refused. The one to write second, and the
  easier of the two to leave out: it needs no forged write, so a chain-only test suite passes with
  the hole open. Assert it for a bare `root.` id in particular, where the other four checks
  pass vacuously -- nothing widens in a one-entry chain, and a root has no parent to violate.
- **A submission carrying a forged `authority` block is refused, and the refusal is a terminal task
  event.** Not a variant of the two above: it is the product-level shape of them, and it is the one
  a reviewer will ask for. Build the attacker before the verifier. A design that has only ever seen
  well-formed capabilities has not been tested, and the tell is a suite where every capability was
  minted by the code under test.
- **Widening is refused:** a child granting a tier or scope its parent does not hold fails
  resolution, whether it widens by one field or replaces the payload wholesale.
- **A concurrent capability belonging to another request is refused:** one agent is handed two
  capabilities at once, at different tiers, for two different humans. Resolving the wider one while
  serving the narrower one's message fails. This is the test that decides whether the caller
  identity is really request-scoped, and it passes vacuously against a shared agent identity -- so
  assert the tiers actually differ and that the refusal is the identity check rather than a
  coincidence of the chain.
- **A cyclic chain is refused, and quickly:** two entries in one broker's own namespace naming each
  other as parent, each naming that broker as delegate, with identical payloads. Resolution fails on
  the visited set rather than running. Assert the refusal is bounded in time: the failure mode being
  tested is a verifier that never returns, so a test that only checks the verdict would hang with
  the bug present.
- **An over-deep chain is refused:** a well-formed chain longer than the bound fails, terminal
  `root.` prefix and all.
- **A rewritten entry is refused, by either route:** write a link, resolve it once, then (a)
  overwrite it in place and (b) in a second run delete it and create the same key again with
  different content. Both resolutions fail on the pinned revision. Test both: create-only writes
  stop (a) and do nothing about (b), since the create succeeds once the key is gone, so a suite that
  only exercises the overwrite passes with the delete path open.
- **An orphan root is refused:** a chain whose terminal entry does not sit under the `root.` prefix
  fails, including one that terminates at a well-formed `hop.` entry.
- **Only the gateway mints roots:** any other connection publishing to `$KV.cap.root.*` gets a
  permissions violation **from the server**, not a rejection from application code. The connection
  is expected to succeed and stay open; the publish is what fails.
- **No broker writes in another broker's namespace:** broker A publishing to `$KV.cap.hop.<B>.*` is
  refused the same way. Assert a dotted key too (`root.task.1` against a grant of `$KV.cap.root.*`):
  a single-token wildcard does not span a dot, and a key scheme that lets an identifier carry one
  escapes the namespace the permission was written to fence.
- **No broker reads the store:** a broker attempting any read of the bucket is refused -- both a
  direct get on `$KV.cap.>` and the JetStream API path to the same stream,
  since denying only the first leaves the second open. Assert this for a broker that legitimately
  participates in a chain, since the whole point is that participation does not imply read.
  **Enumerate over principals and over API subjects, not over the verifier's grant.** This is the
  check that found three principals reading the store through a wildcard issued for other streams
  (§4), and it only found them because it asked every principal rather than checking that the
  verifier's own permissions were right. Cover both stream-name depths and every API verb that can
  return message bodies -- direct get, message get, consumer create and next, snapshot -- since
  denying the obvious two leaves the rest.
- **The permissions are actually configured:** a connection with no capability permissions at all is
  refused the operations above. Written against bare key names rather than `$KV` subjects, each test
  above passes on a server where nothing was configured, so this one is what distinguishes the
  control from its absence. Two ways to satisfy it and both are worth having: give every refused
  principal a **live control** on the same connection -- something it legitimately reaches, so a
  refusal cannot be a broken connection -- and run the verifier's own happy path end to end under
  its rendered grants, so "nobody can" is not accidentally "nothing works."
- **Revocation is immediate:** delete an entry mid-flight; the next resolution of any id descending
  from it fails.
- **The agent never sees the capability:** from inside an agent container, the capability id and the
  KV store are both unreachable -- no bus credential, no verifier route.
