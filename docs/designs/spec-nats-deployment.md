# NATS deployment spec

- **Author:** [@bnaylor]
- **Date:** 2026-08-24
- **Status:** draft, for review
- **Companion:** the A2A payload spec (`spec-a2a-payloads.md`) - owns subjects and message shape

## Purpose

This spec covers the NATS deployment for the A2A fabric: JetStream stream and retention
layout, accounts and connection-time authorization, how the durable stream surfaces as the
audit substrate, and the client resilience contract the stage 1 client library must satisfy.

Subject taxonomy and message shape belong to the A2A payload spec. Both docs landed the
same day, so the planned tie-break rule never fired; the call (8/24) is that the payload
spec's layout wins and this doc binds to its subjects and topic classes.

## What we deploy

NATS 2.10 or later (auth callout requires it), JetStream enabled, file storage on a PV.
The operator renders the whole deployment from the mode switch: `mode: next` gets a NATS
cluster, the default gets nothing. Dark until promoted.

Production guidance is a 3-node cluster with stream replicas R3. Dev and CI run a single
node with R1 under the same config surface - the conformance suite runs against `kind`, so
nothing here may depend on a managed control plane.

**The customer operates this.** Server restarts - rollouts, node drains, PV failover - are
routine operations, not incidents. That fact drives the resilience contract below more than
any other input.

## Streams and retention

**One retention rule before any layout: acknowledgement must not delete.** The durable
stream is the audit substrate for inter-agent traffic, so a message's lifetime is the audit
window, not the delivery lifecycle. Concretely:

- All message streams use **limits-based retention** with an age window. Interest and
  workqueue retention are ruled out - both delete on ack, which destroys replay exactly when
  you want it (after the interaction completed and something looks wrong.)
- Consumers are **durable push with explicit ack** - the downstream can ack, so
  server-tracked delivery is correct. `MaxAckPending` is the back-pressure valve, set per
  stream class.
- Replay is a read, never a consume. Nothing an auditor does can change delivery state.

Streams bind to the payload spec's subjects and topic classes:

| Stream           | Subjects             | Retention                                                        | Consumers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

State and journal topics both live under `a2a.topics.>`, so the two topic streams' subject
lists are rendered per topic from the provisioned registry - which topics exist is already
config, and the retention class lives there too. Shared fan-out (blueprints, config
availability) is the shared topics; recipients that must confirm receipt get durable
consumers on the topic streams. Heartbeats (`agents.hb.>`) are core NATS, outside
JetStream, per the payload spec.

Everything is R3 in production. Status and artifact events are the bulk of the volume and
the tempting place for a cheaper R1 class, but they are also the replay and audit record,
and R1 loses them to a single node failure. Audit wins. The cost knob is W, not replicas.

Every stream also carries a hard `max_bytes` cap with `discard: old` alongside its age
limit (dev defaults: 20GiB `TASKS`, 5GiB `TOPICS-JOURNAL`, 1GiB each for `TOPICS-STATE`
and `DIRECTORY`). A runaway telemetry flood drops oldest chunks early; it never fills
the PV and stalls the whole JetStream deployment, which would take `runtime-state`,
`session-state`, and discovery down with it. The honest cost: under byte pressure,
replay completeness degrades oldest-first - a running task's early events can age out of
a flooded stream - and the byte-headroom alert below exists so that state is paged on
before it is reached.

`TASKS` carries one further limit, `max_msgs_per_subject` (4096; amended 9/16). The cap
above is stream-wide, so one runaway task - a looping harness, a gigabyte of streamed
artifact text - could consume the whole 20GiB budget and, under `discard: old`, evict
every other session's history on the way out. The per-subject cap makes a runaway pay
for its own runaway and nobody else's. Be precise about what it is not: a session's
publish grant is `a2a.tasks.<pod>.*.events` - the task id is not part of the attested
claim, so the grant cannot name one - and a session can therefore mint unbounded
distinct subjects by inventing task ids. A per-subject cap is not a per-publisher
budget, and JetStream has none to reach for. Closing that is a change to the callout's
narrowing, not a stream flag.

The replay consequence, stated rather than discovered later, because `discard: old`
evicts the OLDEST message on a subject first: the oldest event on a task's `…events`
subject is its `submitted` status-update, which assertion 9 requires and which
`FoldTask` folds into `StatusHistory[0]`. A task past the cap replays without its head -
the terminal state survives, the beginning does not. That is only acceptable because the
fold now says so. `lib.Task` carries `SubmittedMissing`, the assertion-9 observation and
the sibling of `PostFinalDropped` for assertion 10, so a truncated replay is a
degradation a reader can see rather than a short history it cannot distinguish from a
real one. On the number, sized against the publisher that means it rather than the
well-behaved one: the render sets no `max_payload`, so NATS' 1MiB default is the
per-message ceiling and 4096 messages is a ~4GiB worst case on one subject - a fifth of
the stream. The worker adapter's own result chunks are 256KiB, so a task built out of
those reaches nearer 1GiB at the same count, but that is a property of one publisher and
not a bound the bus enforces. A chat-driven task emits single digits to low hundreds of
events; reaching 4096 is already a loop or a gigabyte of streamed artifact text. The
alternative that would refuse the write instead of evicting the head, per-subject
`discard: new`, is unavailable: JetStream only honours it under stream-wide `discard:
new`, which contradicts the rule in the paragraph above.

The cap is not on `…events` alone, and the class it also lands on fails more quietly, so
the cap does not ship on its own. A task's `…in` subject holds its originating
`kind:message` submission and then every steer, follow-up and cancel sent afterwards, all
under the same 4096. A worker reads that subject on every start to recover the request it
is executing. Steers are `kind:message` too, and no envelope field marks one as the
submission, so a scan from the beginning returns the oldest surviving steer once the head
is evicted, and the worker executes it as if it were the request. There is no
`SubmittedMissing` on this side, because nothing folds `…in`, so the substitution would be
invisible to the worker and to a reader alike. Reaching 4096 inbound messages on one task
takes a looping delegator rather than a chat, and the only publisher to `…in` is the
gateway - a session's grants carry no publish there at all. So it is rarer than the
`…events` case. But where that one degrades a history, this one changes what the task is,
which is why it is closed here rather than accepted.

The fix puts the answer on the pod rather than on the message. The gateway publishes the
submission before it spawns the session pod, and the ack carries that message's stream
sequence, so the spawner can simply say which one it means: `A2A_ORIGIN_SEQ` in the pod's
env. The adapter opens its `origin` consumer at that sequence and checks what comes back,
because nats-server does not reject an evicted start sequence - it silently delivers the
next message the filter matches, which on this subject is exactly the steer. A mismatch is
a refusal to run, naming both sequences. Marking the submission on the envelope instead
was the obvious cheaper move and does not work: an unmarked head means either "evicted" or
"published by an older gateway", and those are the two cases the check exists to separate.
Evidence about a message cannot travel on that message. On the pod, absence is
unambiguous - it means an older spawner - and a current spawner that cannot determine a
sequence writes `unknown` rather than going quiet, so the degraded path is legible instead
of merely silent.

A get-by-sequence would have been simpler than a consumer and is not available: a session's
grants withhold `STREAM.MSG.GET` and `DIRECT.GET` on purpose, since neither is
subject-scoped and one grant for either reads the whole task plane. A consumer's filter
subject rides its CREATE subject and is already granted per session, so the check costs no
new reach - only a different `deliver` policy on a consumer the worker already creates.

Worth being exact about how loud the refusal actually is, because it is quieter than it
reads. The worker returns the error and exits non-zero, so the message naming both sequences
lands in the pod's log and nowhere else. What the delegator sees is the supervisor's sweep
closing the task `failed` with its generic note - "session pod exited without a terminal
event" - which is a visible failure but not a diagnosis. That is still the right trade
against the alternative this replaces, where the worker ran the wrong input and reported
success. But the refusal is deterministic and permanent, so an operator who does not read
the pod log before the sweep deletes it gets a task that fails forever with no stated cause.
Carrying the reason onto the bus means the worker publishing its own terminal, which it does
not do here - not because the ids are out of reach, but because the adapter takes
`contextId` and `correlationId` off the origin envelope and nowhere else, and that read sits
downstream of the refusal. The values are already on the pod: the spawner annotates every
session pod with both before it starts. Left open below.

What an install that already has a `TASKS` stream gets from the cap is nothing, and the
deployment says that rather than implying otherwise. Provisioning is create-only - the
`stream info X || stream add X` guards never edit - so every limit this render has gained
since an install's stream was created is absent from that stream, and a re-run does not
add it. That is a property of the identity and not only of the script: the grant the
callout mints for the provision principal is `$JS.API.STREAM.CREATE.<s>` and
`$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.<s>` per stream and nothing else, so the Job could not edit a stream
if it tried. Converging would mean adding `$JS.API.STREAM.UPDATE` to the one principal
that runs unattended on every reconcile, next to the DELETE and PURGE that entry already
refuses itself for the reason written beside them. The provision script's closing block
reads the live stream back and reports the gap: it names the `nats stream edit` that
closes it, and what the edit costs. Applying a per-subject cap is a tightening, and a
tightening evicts on every subject already over the limit the moment it lands.
Truncating a running install's task history as an automatic side effect of an operator
upgrade is not a decision provisioning takes on an operator's behalf, so it reports and
exits clean. What it reports that way is the absent bound - a stream carrying no
per-subject limit at all. A stream carrying some other finite cap is bounded already, so
it is reported as drift between the stream and the render rather than as that gap; an
operator who chose the number is not told their stream predates the limit. The
`max_consumers` gap in the same
block is treated the other way - it refuses - because a short consumer budget is not a
bound the install never had but a shortfall with a load-time failure already attached.

Where that report lands: the pod log, and an Event on the `PlatformAgent`. The script
still exits 0, so the Job completes and the CR reads `Ready` - the gap is a report, not a
failure - but the closing block also writes the finding as one line of JSON to the
container's termination message (`/dev/termination-log`, the kubelet's default; `{}` when
it found nothing), and the reconcile that first sees the Job `Complete` reads that off
the Job's succeeded pod and records a `Warning` Event, reason `TasksSubjectCapMissing`,
naming the Job, the live and rendered caps, and the `nats stream edit` with its cost. It
stamps the Job with an annotation so later passes over the same completed Job add
nothing; the 24h TTL removes the finished Job and the next reconcile recreates it under
the same digested name, so an unfixed gap is reported once per run, roughly daily, and
`kubectl describe platformagent` shows it without anyone reading a pod log. It is an
Event and not a condition because it is a fact about the live stream that a Job
discovered, not a state the reconcile converges on; the operator's `Recorder` field
draws that line once. The `max_consumers` refusal in the same block already fails the
Job, which reaches the CR as `Degraded`/`A2AProvisionFailed`.

W is TBD - see Open questions. It is not just a cost knob; see the audit section.

Three KV buckets ride the same JetStream deployment:

- `runtime-state` - which agents are alive, what is in flight. Runtime state does not
  belong in git, and this is where it goes instead.
- `session-state` - the gateway's session registry (session key, `contextId`, current
  pod, roster, and the active task's bounded ask echo - user content, deliberately; the
  gateway design owns the content-vs-identifier rule). The gateway's user is the only
  writer by grant, and since the 8/31 narrowing the only reader too: no other user
  holds `$KV.session-state.>` on either side, and the web user's consumer-create route
  INTO the bucket - a push consumer bound to `KV_session-state` - is closed by the
  per-stream enumeration. One write route survives and is the deliver-subject residue
  recorded with the web user below, not an exception to it: a consumer created on a
  granted stream may aim its deliver subject at `$KV.session-state.>`, and the server's
  own replay publishes land as bucket revisions. What the gateway reads back is
  corruptible that way - current pod name, bus session name, roster - so "only writer"
  is a statement about grants, not a property the subject list enforces. The residue's
  closes are the residue paragraph's: the callout, or a separate account with an
  export/import.
- `cap` - capability entries per the capability envelope design
  (`docs/architecture/09-capability-envelope.md`), which landed on KV-backed
  capabilities. **Armed 9/9**, and the one bucket here whose grant story is a read
  _denial_ rather than a writer narrowing: the gateway may publish under
  `$KV.cap.root.*` and may not read the bucket by any route, no broker may read it at
  all, and the capability verifier is the only principal holding read on an entry. The carve-out
  is `$JS.API.STREAM.CREATE.KV_cap` and `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.KV_cap`, held by the
  callout-authenticated `provision` principal the rendered Job runs as and by the static `seed`
  identity the hand-applied tooling still uses - the `kv info cap || kv add cap` guard needs both
  verbs, and neither returns an entry. That asymmetry is
  the point - the minter must not be able to see what anyone else minted - and because
  it is a denial it has to be enumerated over every principal on the bus rather than
  asserted of one. 09 §3 owns the entry shape; the permissions are asserted in
  `a2a/authcallout` against the config the operator renders.

## Accounts and connection-time authorization

The property this section exists to preserve: **the bus decides who may say what before a
message is read.** Publish and subscribe permissions are checked when the connection is
established. A compromised or prompt-injected agent cannot emit on a subject it has no
claim to, because the connection has no such right - no application code is consulted.

**Authentication is auth callout, not decentralized JWT** - no operator/account key
hierarchy to manage. One signing key does exist, and it is the most powerful thing in
this deployment: the callout issuer key that signs each authorization response, whose
holder can mint arbitrary bus users. The capability envelope design
(`docs/architecture/09-capability-envelope.md`, "one cryptographic key does exist") owns
that analysis; the callout service inherits its hardening requirements. The callout
validates the client's KSA token against the cluster's OIDC issuer (audience-bound,
short-lived, kubelet-rotated) and returns the account and the permission set.

Revocation is the issuer's problem for the credential, and the issuer has solved it: a
projected token is bound to its pod, so the API server stops authenticating it once the
pod object is gone - measured at about ten seconds behind the delete, which is the
TokenReview success cache rather than the token's hour. That governs the NEXT connection
and only the next one. An ALREADY-OPEN connection is not revoked by anything above: the
callout is consulted once, at CONNECT, and the server holds the grants it issued in a
signed user JWT until that JWT expires - the callout's grant TTL, an hour less jitter.
So the bound on a compromised bus client is its grant TTL, not its pod lifetime, and
shortening that exposure means shortening the grant TTL. Both clocks matter and they are
not the same clock; a claim about one is not a claim about the other. This works on stock Kubernetes; there
is no GKE dependency. Concretely, validation is a `TokenReview` call against the local
API server - zero key handling, works on any conformant cluster - with local JWT
verification against the API server's `openid/v1/jwks` endpoint as the offline
alternative.

Status (amended 9/4, the callout armed; amended 9/8, sessions moved; amended 9/15,
`worker` retired; amended 9/9, the verifier added): the render now carries the
`auth_callout` block, and a principal authenticates one of two ways. **Through the
callout**, by presenting a projected ServiceAccount token: the bus provisioning Job,
every spawned session pod, the platform agent container, and the capability verifier. **Statically**, from `nats.conf` and listed in `auth_users`:
the callout itself, which cannot authenticate through the thing it is; the chatops
gateway, purely as sequencing, since it has a ServiceAccount and its client program
lands separately from this render; `web` and `console`, because a browser never can;
`seed`, because the hand-applied seed tooling is applied rather than rendered and
dropping its user would refuse an object already running; `sys`, a human at a
port-forward; and `bridge`, the Hermes bridge sidecar.

The shared `worker` user is gone. It was one credential held by two workloads that
happen to share a pod — the bridge sidecar, which drives the task plane, and the `a2a`
CLI in the agent container, which reads and writes the topic blackboard — so its grant
set was the union of two unrelated jobs, and either workload could do the other's. It
split into `agent` and `bridge`, and neither holds the other's streams.

Five of those static users are permanent - the callout, which cannot authenticate
through itself; `web` and `console`, because a browser never can; `sys`, which is a
human rather than a workload; and `bridge`, for a reason worth stating because it looks
like an omission. The callout keys its map on the ServiceAccount username `TokenReview`
returns, and a sidecar shares its pod's ServiceAccount. A token presented by the bridge
would therefore resolve to the `agent` entry rendered for the container beside it, and
each would hold the union of the two grant sets - `worker` rebuilt under a new name,
arrived at by moving the bridge onto the mechanism meant to narrow it. `Narrowing` does
not help: it is pod-scoped, and both workloads are in the same pod. The bridge gets a
token when it stops sharing a pod with the agent, which is the same event that retires
it. The rest are waiting on something nameable. The single source for all of it - the
config's APP and `$SYS` static user blocks, the callout's map, and the `NATS_USER` a
client is handed so it can set its inbox prefix - is `platformagent_a2a_identities.go`;
before the callout those three lived in a config string, a Secret and a container env
block with nothing but review connecting them. The one static block not in that file is
the callout's own, rendered in the AUTH account template in
`platformagent_a2a_manifests.go`.

Those credentials belong in Secret data and nowhere else in the render: no rendered
object name, label, or annotation may carry a password or a digest of one, truncated or
not. Names and labels are readable by anything that can list the namespace, so a digest
there is an offline target the day a password is hand-set. That binds every renderer of
this stack, not one function - the rollout hash on the NATS pod template is over the
config rendered with placeholders in the passwords' place plus the credentials Secret's
`resourceVersion`, which is what lets a config change and a rotation both roll the bus
without a credential reaching the digest.

Layout:

- **`$SYS`** - human operators and monitoring only. No agent ever authenticates into it.
- **`AUTH`** - the auth callout service and nothing else, and the isolation is a boundary
  rather than tidiness. The server publishes every authorization request into this account
  and takes the first answer that returns on the reply inbox, and it does **not** check
  that the answer's outer envelope was signed by the configured issuer (measured; the
  inner user JWT's signature is checked). So anything able to publish into this account's
  `$SYS._INBOX.>` and win the race can refuse an authorization - it could not forge a
  grant without the issuer seed, but it could deny one. Nothing else belongs in here.
- **One application account per scope.** The account is the tenant boundary and the blast
  radius container. Stage 1 exercises exactly one; the multi-scope split (and any
  cross-account exports) is designed but deliberately unexercised until a second scope
  exists.
- **One user per agent identity** inside the account. Permissions are exact subject
  lists, deny by default: publish only to the subjects its role emits on, subscribe only
  to its own addressee prefix on the task subjects (`a2a.tasks.<its name>.>`) plus the
  shared topics it is granted. That is an upper bound, not the shape every principal has:
  a pull-only principal may hold no task-subject subscribe at all, which is what the
  session grants do. The addressee token in the task subjects (payload spec
  0.4) is what makes these grants expressible - executor-granularity at connect time,
  with per-task scoping still the parked tightening (9/9): the authority work landed
  the capability envelope, which scopes the task's AUTHORITY per task without narrowing
  the subject grants, and narrowing those remains separate and unstarted. **Amended
  10/1:** "deny by default" holds per side, and only while that side has entries in
  it. An empty allow list is nats-server's spelling of _unrestricted_, not of
  _nothing_ (`buildPermissionsFromJwt` builds a side's permission object only when
  that side's allow or deny list is non-empty, and the two sides are independent), so
  a rendered entry that lost its publish list would grant the whole subject space on
  that side while its subscribes stayed narrow. Neither side of a non-narrowed entry
  may therefore be empty: in the callout identity map the operator refuses such a
  render and the callout refuses it again at the mint, and in the static `nats.conf`
  users - which have no validator - a side left empty beside a populated one renders
  an explicit `deny = [">"]` rather than an absent key. A user with NEITHER side,
  which is how `sys` ships, still gets no permissions block at all. A principal that
  must not publish cannot be expressed by omission - there is no deny list in the map
  - so it has to be left unrendered rather than rendered empty.
- **Three task-subject classes, and the publish grants split along them** (9/9, payload
  spec 0.4). `…in` is the requester's, `…events` the executor's, and `…supervisor` the
  supervisor's - one writer class each, which is the whole point: a consumer derives the
  publisher from the subject, so a class with two rendered writers derives nothing. A
  supervisor terminal sitting on the executor's subject is exactly what a hostile executor
  would forge, so the supervisor's terminal grant and the executor's must not name the
  same subject. **The grant lists are the render's, not this document's**:
  `platformagent_a2a_identities.go` and the golden
  `a2a/authcallout/testdata/rendered-nats.conf` are what to read and what to reconcile
  toward, and the rule above is what they are meant to satisfy - an earlier draft of this
  bullet had it the other way round and enumerated the lists here as canonical, which
  invites squaring the render against prose. Two consequences of the split the render does
  not show on its face. First, the supervisor grant is a wildcard over the ADDRESSEE
  (`a2a.tasks.*.*.supervisor`), not a scope to the sessions the gateway spawned, which a
  static render cannot express - so it reaches every profile's supervisor subject too, and
  a profile task's `…supervisor` must not be modelled as unreachable. Second, the class
  that is not yet single-writer is `…events`, and the holder is the static `worker`
  credential the Hermes bridge authenticates with: its `a2a.tasks.*.*.events` wildcards the
  addressee token, so it reaches session and profile subjects alike until that credential
  is retired. A session's grant, by contrast, is derived per incarnation by the auth
  callout and reaches only its own pod's `…events`. `spec-a2a-payloads.md` states the
  consumer rule that rests on all of this and enumerates what is not yet decision-grade -
  including a redirection route onto `…supervisor` that no assertion pins. Read that
  section before treating any class as closed.
- **The JetStream tax.** Deny-by-default reaches JetStream's own plumbing, and three
  grants are part of being a JetStream client at all: the `$JS.API` subjects a role's
  streams and buckets need, enumerated per stream and per verb where the caller set is
  known (the bridge's list is the operator's `a2aBridgeJetStreamGrants`, the agent
  CLI's is `a2aAgentJetStreamGrants` and the gateway's is
  `a2aGatewayJetStreamGrants`; no rendered principal holds `$JS.API.>` any more, and a
  user that gains one back holds playground posture); `$JS.ACK.<its streams>.>` for explicit
  acks - an ack is a publish, and missing this grant means every consumer redelivers
  forever while TCP health stays green, the NR-5 incident class created at connect time;
  and `$JS.FC.>` for flow control. The inbox rule cuts both ways, too: a client whose subscribe grant
  is `_INBOX.<user>.>` MUST configure its inbox prefix to match - the client library's
  default random inbox is refused by the user's own grant and every API call times out.
  Both halves were found live (8/26): the provision Job could never succeed and no
  consumer could ever ack until these landed. The ack grant should be scoped per
  stream, for the reason the web section below teaches: an ack subject names a stream
  and a consumer, never the caller, so an unscoped `$JS.ACK.>` lets any holder `+TERM`
  another principal's in-flight delivery. That narrowing has landed: every rendered
  principal's ack grant is scoped to the streams it consumes with explicit ack -
  `$JS.ACK.TASKS.>` for the gateway and the bridge - and the principals whose reads
  are ordered or ack-none hold no ack grant at all. What scoping still cannot express is
  per-consumer scope inside a granted stream, since NATS wildcards match whole tokens.
  Enumerating leaves one refusal that is expected rather than a fault: the gateway's
  `tasks/get` replay reads through an ordered consumer whose reset path publishes
  `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.TASKS.<server-generated name>` and ignores the answer, so a
  reconnect writes one refusal per replay in flight into the bus log and into the
  gateway's own log at Error. That subject is the only violation a rendered principal
  produces by design; any other one is a missed grant.
- **Topic publish grants are exact, never namespace wildcards.** Publish grants match
  the provisioned topic list subject-for-subject. A wildcard over a topic namespace
  turns provisioned-only into silent loss - a publish to an unprovisioned topic sails
  into core NATS and vanishes; an exact grant makes it a connect-time refusal. The
  corollary is operational: adding a topic is two edits that must travel together, the
  stream's subject list and the writer's grant. The rationale is publish-side only: a
  read-side wildcard (`a2a.topics.>` in a subscribe list) loses nothing and stays fine.
- **Per-user inbox prefixes.** Push delivery uses inbox subjects, so each user gets its own
  prefix (`_INBOX.<user>.>`) and permission to subscribe only to that. Without this, any
  agent can subscribe to any inbox and the whole property above leaks through the reply
  path.
- **The web read surface (amended 8/31; rewritten the same day after review).** One
  `web` user for the read-only web UI, one of the two bus credentials published to a
  browser by design (the other is `console`, below). Subscribe on `a2a.>` and its own
  inbox; publish only the JetStream read API - account-level `INFO`, and `STREAM.INFO`,
  `CONSUMER.CREATE`, `CONSUMER.INFO`, `CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT` **enumerated per stream** over
  the four message streams - plus its own inbox. It rides a websocket listener on 9222
  rendered plain (`no_tls: true`) with an `allowed_origins` allow-list.

  **"Read-only" is not expressible as a subject list, and the first version of this user
  proved it.** Subject permissions cannot see a request BODY, and JetStream puts the
  reach there - a consumer's target stream, its durability and its delivery subject are
  all fields. Reproduced live against the rendered config before the narrowing:
  `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.>` let `web` build a push consumer on
  `KV_session-state` delivering into its own inbox and read the session registry out of a
  bucket it has no `$KV` grant for (subscribe permissions are not consulted at consumer
  creation; the deliver subject is); `$JS.ACK.>` let it publish `+TERM` onto the
  gateway's in-flight delivery, because an ack subject names a stream and a consumer and
  never the caller. The consumer-create escape is closed by the enumeration; the ack
  escape by deleting the grant outright - web consumers are ack-none by design, so a
  well-behaved client needs no ack grant (and no `$JS.FC.>`: ack-none push takes no
  flow control), while granting either would reopen what the deletion closed. Ack
  policy is a body field, so ack-none is a design intent the grant list cannot
  enforce - the residue is recorded below with its siblings. The lesson generalises past this
  user: **for JetStream, a grant list is a capability surface, not a read/write
  distinction** - enumerate the streams, and never hand a browser-facing user
  `$JS.API.>`.

  Residues, none of them "can read what it shouldn't", and none of them closed by the
  auth callout - `web` is browser-facing and therefore permanently statically
  authenticated, so the callout never reaches it:
  durability is a body field, so withholding the legacy `DURABLE.CREATE` subject does not
  prevent a durable - `max_consumers` per stream bounds the cost instead (amended 9/16:
  on `TASKS` that bound is no longer the flat 64 but a number derived from
  `spec.harness.tuning.maxSessions`, since a session pod creates three consumers there
  and a stream that cannot hold the configured concurrency refuses a legitimate session.
  The number is `maxSessions` times three plus a reserve for what is nobody's
  session, itemized term by named term beside `a2aTasksReservedConsumers` in the
  operator: the two standing durables, headroom for the audit durable, one incarnation's
  overlap, the web rail's readers, and - amended 9/25 - the `tasks/get` replay
  ephemerals. A replay's ordered consumer holds a slot for five seconds after the call
  returns, its inactive threshold, so the term counts what the replaying callers can hold
  in flight at once and one tail each; the callers that replay in a loop with nothing
  between calls are named there as what the term does not size for. Amended 9/28: the
  replay term scales with the bridge's worker count, which the render reads as
  `BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` off `spec.deployment.sidecars` and, when the operator renders the
  bridge itself, off the operator's `A2A_BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` setting, read by the same rule
  (10, the rendered bridge's default, when unset) - the sum over every sidecar that
  sets it, each read as the bridge runs it: the literal, with a `$(NAME)` reference to an
  earlier literal in the same sidecar expanded as the kubelet expands it, or the bridge's
  default of 2 for a `valueFrom` or a reference to one, an unparsable value or one below
  one, and 2 when nothing sets it, and at
  most 1024, the bridge's queue capacity, since the CRD bounds `maxSessions` at 10000 against
  the same wrap and a sidecar's env is bounded nowhere else - so the reserve moves with the
  bridge's worker count, and each surface says what it read. The provision script's refusal
  quotes the count it used, the per-entry rule it read it by, and whether it capped it; the
  `Ready` condition's message on that refusal says, when an entry it could not read as a
  count took the default in its place, that the count is what the render read, not what the
  CR declares, and states the rule; and the script prints a `NOTE:` on every run, refused or
  not, when an entry took the default or a sidecar carries `envFrom` with no entry in `env`
  (a `BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` delivered through `envFrom` is not read), since the budget may then
  be short for the real count with no refusal to say so. Where the count is above the
  default, both refusal surfaces offer fewer workers (on a rendered bridge, a lower
  `A2A_BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY`) as the third way out beside a lower
  `maxSessions` and a deleted stream; the message attributes the need to the count wherever
  it moved the reserve, one worker included.
  The trade is stated where it is made: an install that raises `maxSessions` raises
  `web`'s unreapable-durable ceiling in the same proportion. Deriving downward on a small
  install would silently tighten a working one, so the render takes the larger of 64 and
  the derived budget. Because creates never edit, an install whose `maxSessions` already
  exceeds what its stream holds is under-provisioned today, and the check is reached on
  an operator upgrade alone with no CR edit involved - it runs last, after every other
  stream and bucket, so the refusal leaves a fully provisioned bus short one limit rather
  than a half-built one); ack policy is
  the same class of body field, so a hostile holder can create an explicit-ack consumer
  it holds no grant to ack - endless redeliveries, churn against the server, and an
  amplifier for the deliver-subject write below; within the four
  granted streams consumer names are the caller's choice, so `web` can pull a delivery
  off another reader's consumer or retune it through create-as-update - a route that
  reaches the gateway's relay durable from `bridge` too, measured on the render: one
  permitted `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.TASKS.gateway-relay` retunes its filter subject, and
  one carrying `inactive_threshold` has the server reap it, ack floor and all, with
  `CONSUMER.DELETE` refused in the same run; and a consumer's
  deliver subject can aim replay of stored messages at another stream's subject, which is
  a persisted write under the messages' original subjects - not forgery, since a read by
  subject never sees them, but an eviction lever against the capturing stream. Delivery
  needs a subscription whose subject is **exactly** the deliver subject - a push consumer
  registers through `Sublist.registerNotification`, which takes interest only from a match
  that is byte-equal, so a wildcard subscription covering the deliver subject supplies
  none - and that splits the streams
  (measured on 2.10.29 and 2.14.5): the topic streams have literal subjects, so their own
  ingest is the interest and the write lands unaided; DIRECTORY, TASKS and the buckets
  have wildcard subjects, so reaching
  `a2a.agents.>` (the identity plane) takes a principal subscribed to a card subject
  itself. A watcher on `a2a.agents.>` - exactly `gateway`'s subscribe grant, and inside
  `web`'s `a2a.>` - is not that principal: measured, DIRECTORY stayed empty.
  This survives per-stream scoping of any user that may create consumers at all, the
  bridge included; the closure is not holding `CONSUMER.CREATE`, which is a consumer
  created per task by the dispatcher. Per-name scoping is **not** available as a
  mitigation _where the caller chooses its own consumer names_: NATS wildcards match whole
  tokens, so a `web-*` grant matches a consumer literally named `web-*` and nothing else -
  measured, not assumed. The session principal is the case where it does work, and why:
  its consumer names are derived from the pod the API server attested rather than chosen
  by the client, so the grant can name them exactly instead of by prefix. The real close is a
  separate account with an export/import, which stays open.

  **The probe subject.** `a2a.topics.shared.probe` is provisioned into `TOPICS-STATE`
  with **no writer in any user's publish list** - the single deliberate exception to the
  rule above that a topic's subject list and its writer's grant travel together. It
  exists so an authorization probe has a real provisioned subject to be refused on: a
  refusal against an unprovisioned subject proves only that the subject is missing, while
  a refusal here proves the grant. Aiming such a probe at a topic the fleet reads means
  that the one time the grant is wrong, the probe writes junk into standing state; a
  writerless subject makes that failure land nowhere.

  Posture, stated accurately: plain ws puts the credential on the pod network in
  cleartext, and the Service is ClusterIP, so nothing outside the cluster reaches it.
  Amended 8/31: the pod network is fenced too. The operator renders an ingress
  NetworkPolicy on the NATS pod granting **4222 to exactly the enumerated bus clients**
  (the auth callout, the agent pod - whose sidecars, the Hermes bridge included, share
  its labels - the A2A gateway, the capability verifier, session pods by the spawner's
  labels, the provision Job,
  and the hand-applied seed Job), and ~~**no pod-network peer for 8222 or 9222**~~ **no
  pod-network peer for 8222, and one for 9222: the console server (amended 9/24,
  below)**. The demo's
  `kubectl port-forward` and the kubelet's readiness probe both enter from the node,
  which NetworkPolicy does not govern, so the ws surface stays reachable through
  kubectl and, in-cluster, through the console server alone. The enumeration is today's client
  list, and it must grow with the components this spec designs. The auth callout was
  the first, and it landed in the same change that armed the callout rather than after
  it, for the reason that makes this rule worth having: the callout is itself a bus
  client sitting on the connection path, so a fence that does not name it refuses the
  one peer every new connection depends on - and nothing looks broken when that
  happens, because established connections are already authorized and keep working
  while the fabric silently accepts no new client. Still owed as they arm: the audit
  exporter, the janitor, and the metrics scrape (the alert set above is scraped
  series), and the NATS pods themselves on their route port the moment the deployment
  leaves the single-node dev shape - a 3-node cluster's servers dial each other, and a
  fence without the route peer prevents the cluster from ever forming. The topic-grant corollary that two edits
  travel together, applied to the fence. A second policy in the same amendment
  fences the session pods' egress (DNS, 4222 by label, LiteLLM - a spawned worker has no
  other legitimate destination, save the credential broker on its one port when the
  operator's `A2A_SESSION_CLUSTER_VIEW` flag is on; see `spec-mode-switch.md`). **Amended 9/8:** a session pod now carries a
  ServiceAccount and a projected bus token, so the reason for the fence's shape changed
  while the fence did not. The kubelet delivers that token through a volume, so the
  credential arrives without the pod dialling anything, and this policy is what withholds
  the API-server route it would otherwise imply; automount stays off so no second
  default-audience token rides along; and the session ServiceAccount holds no RBAC and no
  Workload Identity. The pod that executes model output is the one place three
  independent reasons is the right number. The origin
  allow-list (`allowed_origins`, not `same_origin`, which can never match a UI on a
  different port) remains the browser-side control: WebSockets are exempt from CORS,
  so for as long as a port-forward runs, any page the operator's browser visits could
  otherwise drive this surface.

- **The console surface (added 9/23).** One `console` user for the web console: the `web`
  read surface exactly, plus publish on `chat.console.*.in` (the gateway's console adapter's
  inbound subject, spec-chatops-gateway.md), and subscribe on `chat.console.*.out`. The
  console holds no verb on any `KV_*` stream, because `STREAM.INFO` accepts a
  `subjects_filter` in its body and returns every key, which for `session-state` is the
  conversation and task ids; the capacity tiles that wanted bucket sizes are deferred until
  a sizes-only route exists. The gateway user gains the matching pair (subscribe `.in`,
  publish `.out`). The console subjects are core NATS, so
  the provision Job is untouched and an existing install picks the door up on operator
  upgrade. Same posture as `web` and stated in the same places: static, published to a
  browser by design, port-forward only.

  **Amended 9/24:** the page is served by an operator-rendered console server
  (`<agent>-a2a-console`), which answers the browser on its own port, hands the page the
  `console` password from the creds Secret, and proxies the page's websocket to 9222. It is
  the one pod-network peer the NATS fence admits on 9222, by label, and its own pod carries
  a deny-all ingress policy, so it too is reachable only through `kubectl port-forward`.
  The origin allow-list moves to `http://localhost:8080` and `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, the
  console server's forwarded address, and the proxy passes the browser's `Origin` through,
  so the check still sees the page. `same_origin` would still never match, because the bus
  sees the proxy's `Host`, not the browser's. The server answers only a `Host` naming that
  forwarded address, so a forward to any other local port gets a refusal naming the right
  one. The `web` user keeps the same posture it had: a 9222 port-forward and a page that
  brings its own password. The access gate moves with the credential: before this, reading
  the `console` password needed `get` on the creds Secret, and now `pods/portforward` to
  the console pod is enough, because `/config.json` hands the password to the page, and to
  any other process running locally while the forward is open.

- **Bucket access is subject access.** KV and the Object Store ride internal subjects -
  `$KV.{bucket}.>`, `$O.{bucket}.C.>` / `$O.{bucket}.M.>`, plus the `$JS.API` surface for
  their streams - and the deny-by-default map grants them explicitly per role: the
  gateway gets `session-state`, the artifact bucket goes to whoever writes artifacts,
  nobody gets a bucket their role doesn't name. **Amended 9/8:** that last clause now
  binds the session worker too, and it names none - the derived per-session grant set
  below has no `$KV` or `$O` subject in it at all. Nothing breaks today, because the
  worker adapter never offloads: it chunks artifact updates onto its own events
  subject under the bus message limit (`resultChunkSize`) rather than writing a
  bucket. What it means is that the bucket path is not available to a session, and
  that is deliberate rather than an oversight - bucket scoping is the parked question
  in the next sentence, and granting a session the bucket before scoping it would
  hand every session every other session's artifacts. Miss this and the first oversized artifact dies with an
  Authorization Violation. Within the artifact bucket, visibility is bucket-wide;
  per-task artifact scoping is still parked. Per-session credentials landed (9/8) and did
  not close it: a session's grants are derived from its pod name, which the gateway mints
  one of per task, so the scope is per incarnation and the KV buckets are not in a
  session's grant set at all. Scoping the bucket itself is a separate change.

The callout reads an identity-to-permissions map rendered by the operator (**amended
8/24** for the subagent framework; **amended 9/4** to what ships): one entry per
callout-authenticated principal, keyed by the ServiceAccount as TokenReview spells it
(`system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<name>`), rendered into ConfigMap
`<agent>-a2a-authmap` under key `identities.json`. **Amended 9/8:** that is now two
entries - the provisioning Job and the session principal. **Amended 9/15:** three, the
platform agent container having joined them when `worker` was retired. **Amended 9/9:**
four, the capability verifier having joined them; it is callout-authenticated for the
same reason the others are, and keying the only read grant on the capability store to a
ServiceAccount rather than to a password is the point. The agent container's entry is
keyed on the agent's own ServiceAccount and carries the blackboard grants and nothing
else. The bridge sidecar is **not** among them and cannot be, for the ServiceAccount
reason in the status section above: it would key to the agent's entry. Nor is the
gateway - also a static `nats.conf` user for now - and there is no audit exporter or
janitor yet. The designed shape is one entry per
`AgentProfile` rendered from the CR's bus grants, which arrives with the CRD.

The session entry is a different kind of entry and the difference is load-bearing. Every
session pod runs as one shared ServiceAccount, so the ServiceAccount alone cannot tell two
sessions apart; what can is the pod. A projected token is bound by the kubelet to the pod
it was issued into, `TokenReview` reports that pod's name and UID in the user's `Extra`
fields, the API server stops authenticating the token once the pod object is gone, and the
gateway names the pod after the bus session - so the attested pod name IS the addressee.
The entry therefore carries `narrowing: "pod"` and **no grants at all**: they are built at
mint time from the attested name. An entry that both narrowed and carried grants would be
one skipped code path, or one well-meaning map edit, away from handing every session the
whole list - the shared `worker` credential reborn under a new name, and it would look
correct in review. The callout refuses such an entry at parse. No claim, no grants, no
connection.

A narrowed user is named for its pod, and that name is also its inbox prefix, so a pod
named after another principal would be granted that principal's `_INBOX.<user>.>` and
could read or forge the JetStream replies delivered there. The gateway never mints such a
name, but anyone who can create a pod under a narrowed ServiceAccount can. The callout
therefore refuses a narrowed pod whose name is one of the static `nats.conf` users: the
callout's own user and every static identity, the same list `auth_users` is rendered from.
No identity map carries those names, so the operator renders them into the callout's
`A2A_RESERVED_PRINCIPALS` environment variable as a comma-separated list. The callout does
not read `nats.conf`, which carries every static user's password. It refuses to start if
the variable is missing, empty, or holds anything but dot-free DNS-1123 labels; a smaller
set would quietly admit a pod named after the dropped user. The list is fixed for the life
of the process, and that is enough: it changes only when the operator's render does, and a
changed value changes the pod template, which rolls the callout. The same check also
refuses a narrowed pod named after a user in the callout's own identity map (`provision`,
`agent`, `verifier`, `session`, and any user the map gains), because the callout mints
each entry that is not narrowed under its `user` and that entry's grants carry
`_INBOX.<user>.>`; the narrowed entry's own user, `session`, is never minted and is
reserved with the rest because one check covers every map user. Those names
come from the map being served, not from the variable: they are built when the map is
parsed and installed with it, so a reload that adds or removes a user moves the reserved
set in the same step, and a connection is checked against the users of the map its
identity was resolved from. The callout refuses a map whose users are not dot-free DNS-1123
labels too, because the check compares pod names byte for byte: a map user `a.b` would sit
inside the `_INBOX.a.>` grant of a pod named `a` without matching it. A removed user's name is released at once, but the reload
revokes nothing: connections the removed principal already holds keep its inbox until
their user JWT expires, at most the callout's grant lifetime (one hour by default; the
operator does not set `A2A_GRANT_TTL_SECONDS`), and a narrowed pod named after it can be
minted the same inbox inside that window. Only an operator re-render removes a map user,
and the window is accepted. The refusal reason says which kind of name the pod copies.

The pod name is also the session's task addressee. The callout keys the events a narrowed
pod may publish, the consumers it may create over `.in`, and its capability verify and
reply subjects on that name, so a pod named after another addressee would be handed that
addressee's task subjects. The gateway never mints such a name, but anyone who can create a
pod under a narrowed ServiceAccount can, so the same check refuses a narrowed pod whose name
is a fixed-name addressee. Today that is `platform`: the gateway's default addressee, which
the operator leaves unset so the gateway keeps its own default, and the only addressee the
bridge's grants name. The operator renders the list into the callout's
`A2A_RESERVED_ADDRESSEES` environment variable, from the constant the bridge's grants are
built from, and an operator test holds it to both defaults in the a2a module. The callout
refuses to start if the variable is missing, empty, or holds anything but dot-free DNS-1123
labels. Session addressees need no entry, since each is the name of the pod that is that
addressee. Two kinds are not on the list. One is the name a `BRIDGE_PROFILE` override
sets, which leaves the bridge unable to publish its own events because its grants still
name `platform`. The other is `AgentProfile` addressees, which come and go with their CRs:
a narrowed pod named after a profile would be handed that profile's task subjects, so
profiles need the same refusal, from a set that follows them, when the CRD lands.

A reaped session's credential stops working because the pod object is gone, not because
the token expired: measured on envtest 1.36, a zero-grace pod delete invalidated the token
10.1 seconds later, the API server's successful-authentication cache being the delay. The
one-hour token lifetime is not the revocation story and must not be read as one.
Profiles come and go at runtime, so the map cannot be a static gitops artifact; the CRs
are the declarative source and admission bounds what a profile may grant. The agents
never read the map - the constrained party does not see its own ceiling, it just hits it.
The callout reads the map through an API informer, not a volume mount: kubelet ConfigMap
sync lags up to a minute, and the dispatcher can spawn a Job seconds after a profile
lands - a race that ends in an Authorization Violation for a legitimate worker. The
ordering is enforced, not hoped for: nothing dispatches before one callout replica is
ready on the current spec, read from the callout Deployment's status (the 9/17 amendment
below has the rule), and `BusCredentialsReady` is the operator's claim about the callout
as a whole - every replica ready and on the current spec - set only after the callout
reports serving. Submissions queue on the stream meanwhile; nothing is lost. The callout logs the
map version it is serving and exposes it at runtime on `/status` and `/readyz`, so "the
map says X" is checkable against the running system rather than against the rendered
object.

**What ships today is coarser than that sentence, and the gap is deliberate.** The
condition is on the `PlatformAgent`, not on an `AgentProfile`, because the profile CRD
does not exist yet.

**Amended 9/16: the second half of the sentence is enforced now (as written here; the
9/17 amendment narrows what the gate reads).** "Nothing dispatches before that condition
is true", the rule sentence as it read until 9/17, used to describe an intention - the operator wrote
`BusCredentialsReady` and no code in this repository read it. The dispatcher it was
waiting for turns out to be one that already ships: the A2A gateway is what spawns
session pods and relays their work onto the bus. It is not the only thing that
dispatches, since the Hermes bridge sidecar holds a durable on the task subjects too,
but it is the only one whose work needs the callout: a session pod authenticates with a
projected token and nothing else mints that. The gateway's own connection does not need
it. The gateway is a static principal in `auth_users`, exactly as the bridge is. So the
operator withholds the gateway Deployment's _creation_ until the condition is true
(`a2aGatewayWaitsForCallout`), and reconciles it normally once it exists. Creation
only, and the distinction is the whole design: a callout outage after
the gateway is up is an outage, not a reason to freeze a running gateway's image and
environment at whatever the outage happened to interrupt - and the session pods already
spawned carry an `ownerReference` to that Deployment, so withholding it is not a neutral
act. The ordering holds where it is a real ordering, without making the callout a
liveness dependency of everything downstream. One caveat, because it is visible in a
`kubectl get` transcript: `syncBusCredentialsReady` is deferred to the way out of the
reconcile, so a gate reading the condition sees it one pass old. Stale-false costs only
a delay: the gateway is held one more pass and the held reconcile requeues. Stale-true
is a wrong answer, and worth naming as one - the gate can let a first creation through
on a callout that was serving as recently as the previous pass and is not serving now.
What bounds it is that one pass, the same window the condition's own doc comment already
accepts. The gate's other read is deliberately not left to a cache, because there the
asymmetry runs the other way: whether the gateway Deployment already exists is asked of
the API server live rather than of the Deployment informer, since a stale _hit_ - an
informer that has not yet seen the Deployment gone - answers "already there" and lets it
be re-created while the condition is false, which is the single thing the gate exists to
prevent. A stale NotFound costs one held pass and a requeue.

**Amended 9/17: the hold is on the phase now, and the gate asks for one serving
replica.** The condition is a claim about the callout as a whole - every replica ready
and on the current spec - and that is strictly more than a new gateway needs, because
the callout replicas form a queue group and one of them serving answers every
authorization request. A gate that read the condition therefore withheld a _first_
gateway creation on a callout stuck at one of two ready for as long as it stayed there,
which on a cluster with no headroom for the second pod is indefinite. The condition keeps
its strict rule, because it answers "is the callout as a whole serving map V" and the
operator reading it relies on that. The gate no longer reads it. It computes its own
answer from the callout Deployment's status (`a2aCalloutCanServeANewGateway`), and it is
not "at least one ready": `ReadyReplicas` and `UpdatedReplicas` are independent counts,
so that rule cannot tell one ready replica on the current template from two ready
replicas on the previous one, and under `maxUnavailable: 0` a roll wedged on a pod too
old to parse the rendered identity map sits at exactly `Ready=2, Updated=1, Replicas=3`.
The rule is `ObservedGeneration >= Generation` and
`ReadyReplicas + UpdatedReplicas - Replicas >= 1`: an inclusion-exclusion lower bound on
the pods that are both ready and on the current template, so it can never read true when
none is. It admits the second replica Pending (`1 + 2 - 2 = 1`) and rejects the wedged
roll (`2 + 1 - 3 = 0`). The arithmetic holds for the object it is given, and the gate
also has to know it is given the right one: it reads the callout from the informer after
the same pass server-side-applied it, and the informer learns of that write by watch
event, so on a pass that changes the callout's pod template (a schema bump of the
identity map, a new callout image, an operator upgrade) the informer can still hold the
copy from before the write - previous `Generation`, `ObservedGeneration` equal to it,
every replica ready and updated on the template just replaced - and the counts on that
copy read serving while no replica is on the current template. The apply's response
carries the `Generation` the write produced, and the gate refuses a copy whose
`Generation` has not reached it. Its error directions are then both false negatives, each
costing exactly the held pass and requeue that the gate already pays: a terminated pod
still counted in `Status.Replicas` (`1 + 1 - 2 = 0`), and an informer that has not yet
delivered the pass's own apply. The callout Deployment is owned, so the status change
that closes the first window and the watch event that closes the second each trigger the
pass that clears it. The two signals now disagree on purpose, and only in the safe
direction: the gate never passes on a callout the condition's `False` describes as having
no current-template replica serving, and a gateway let through beside a `False` condition
has a serving replica to mint against. The stale-true paragraph above no longer applies
to the gate: it reads the Deployment from the informer rather than a condition written a
pass earlier, and the `Generation` check is what keeps a stale informer copy from
standing in for a stale condition; the live read for "already there" is unchanged. The
delay also stopped being invisible. Under
`mode: next` the A2A gateway is one of the workloads `Ready` is computed from
(`readSplitWorkloads`), so an install held at the gate reads `Provisioning` with a
message naming the Deployment - rather than a `Ready: True` sitting above an absent
dispatcher.

**Amended 9/8.** The condition asserts that the callout Deployment is Available with
every replica ready - and since the readiness probe answers 503 until a map is being
served AND the replica is attached to the bus, that means every replica is serving one
and can be reached to answer with it. The bus half of that probe was added after the
first version of this paragraph: a replica holding a good map with a dead connection
answers no authorization request, and it was the one state no health signal represented,
so the Deployment stayed Available and this condition stayed true while the bus
authorized nobody. Reasons are `CalloutServing`,
`CalloutUnavailable` and `CalloutAbsent`, and the message names the rendered map version.
It does **not** confirm that a named replica has observed a named version: a sub-second
window after a re-render can report ready while a replica still serves the previous map.
That is acceptable while the identity set changes only when the operator re-renders it,
and it stops being acceptable when profiles arrive at runtime - at which point this
becomes a per-replica version check, which is exactly what the status endpoint already
exposes. Rolling the callout pods on every map change would close the gap and was
rejected: the callout is on the connection path, so a rolling restart is a window in
which new connections fail, which is the thing the informer exists to avoid.

Three numbers in the render are load-bearing and none of them is a preference.

**`max_control_line: 65536`.** A ServiceAccount token travels inside the client's CONNECT
frame, and the 4096 default bounds that whole frame - measured, the usable room for the
token is around 3920 bytes once the rest of the CONNECT JSON is counted. A token bound to
several audiences, from a client with a long name, does not fit. The failure is not
graceful: the server closes the connection with "Maximum Control Line Exceeded" _before_
authentication happens, so it reads as the bus refusing a workload rather than as a size
limit.

**`authorization.timeout: 2`.** A ceiling, not a tuning knob. The server starts a
first-ping timer on a connection that has not yet authenticated at roughly two seconds,
and the Go client aborts the connect on a PING where it required a PONG - reporting
"expected 'PONG', got 'PING'", which names nothing about authorization and sends whoever
is debugging it to the network layer. A merely _slow_ callout hits this too, so the real
budget for a TokenReview round trip is under two seconds whatever this number says.

**The token contract.** Audience `a2a-bus`, mounted at `/var/run/secrets/a2a-bus/token`,
3600s expiry, kubelet-rotated. The audience is the load-bearing part: a TokenReview that
requests no audience validates against the API server's own, which every ordinary pod's
default ServiceAccount token already carries - so without the binding the bus would accept
any readable token in the cluster as proof of that pod's identity. A long-lived client
MUST re-read the file when it reconnects rather than caching its first read, or it fails
exactly when the bus restarts, which this spec calls a routine operation.

The audience also has to be reserved, and reserving it is not the same as owning it. The
projection is the platform-agent container's, but the callout resolves the POD's
ServiceAccount, so any container in that pod presenting a token for this audience
authenticates as `agent` - and `spec.deployment.sidecarVolumes` and `.extraVolumes` are
copied into the pod verbatim. The operator therefore refuses and strips user-authored
volumes by SOURCE as well as by name: a projection of this audience under any name, and a
`secret` volume or projected `secret` source naming one of the three Secrets the bus
renders. (Those two source fields only - the ones that mount the Secret into the
container. `csi.nodePublishSecretRef` and the storage drivers' `secretRef` hand it to a
node plugin instead, and are not matched.) The three are `<agent>-a2a-nats-creds`,
which holds the static users' passwords; `<agent>-a2a-nats-config`, whose `nats.conf`
interpolates every one of those passwords in clear text; and `<agent>-a2a-callout-keys`,
which signs the bus's own tokens. The Secrets are cheaper than the projection, because
reading one needs no token at all. All of them are closed together, because closing one
narrows the expensive route, leaves the cheap ones, and names the class while doing it.

Two layers, and they are not the same layer. The admission refusal is unconditional, is
the only one that tells the CR's author why, and covers mounts as well as volumes:
`extraVolumeMounts` and the sidecar and init containers' `volumeMounts` are all checked
against the reserved names. The render strip is gated on the A2A surface, so it runs
under `next` and not under `today` (and on a CR whose `spec.mode` this build does not
recognise, which `a2aAgentSurface` counts as the new surface on purpose - see the comment
on that function). On the mounts it goes further than admission does: besides the
reserved names it drops any mount naming a volume it has just dropped by source, because
a volume dropped while a mount still names it is a Deployment the API server refuses. Neither
layer touches `sidecars[].env` or `.envFrom`, which reach the same Secrets with no volume
at all; that is deliberate, because it is the supported route for a CR-declared Hermes
bridge sidecar, which is meant to hold `bridge-password`. The bridge the operator renders
under `next` gets the same key as a `secretKeyRef` the operator writes itself.

Read on the right terms, which are narrower than the mechanism suggests: KSA tokens are
pod-scoped and the callout cannot see which container presented one, so this is a guard
against a misconfigured CR rather than a boundary against a hostile sidecar. It is worth
having because the CR is authored by the platform operator and not by the agent -
[`security-requirements.md`](../security-requirements.md) already puts administrator-supplied volumes and mounts outside
the sandbox guarantee for the same reason. What would change that reading is a change in
who may write the CR: a tenant-facing role on `platformagents`, or the CR moving into a
repository the agent can open pull requests against. The only construction that would be
a boundary is a separate pod for the bus identity, which is also what the `bridge`
sidecar's static password is waiting on.

The callout service runs in its own `AUTH` account - not `$SYS`, despite subscribing to
a `$SYS.REQ.*` subject - with 2 replicas, joined in a queue group. The queue group is
not optional above one replica: with a plain subscription every replica answers every
request and the server silently takes whichever arrives first, which makes authorization
a latency race whenever a rollout has two policy versions live at once. It is on the connection
path: if it is down, no _new_ connection succeeds, while established connections
continue. The blast radius, named honestly: during a callout outage nothing new
connects, which means no new tasks and no new workers - the fabric is dark to new work,
not gracefully degraded. Established sessions and the resilience contract below are
what make that acceptable at this stage; a hardened HA callout is production posture,
not part of the dev toggle.

**The throughput ceiling, so it is known rather than discovered.** A replica answers
authorization requests one at a time: the subscription is a queue-group subscription with
an async handler, the client library dispatches one subscription's callbacks from one
goroutine, and the handler does its TokenReview round trip inline. Two replicas is
therefore two authorizations in flight for the whole fabric, and a slow API server sets
the rate directly: two divided by the TokenReview latency, which is about 20 connections a
second at a 100ms round trip. The queue behind it is bounded by the same under-two-second
budget as everything else on this path. Measured, not read off the code, by
`TestTheCalloutAnswersOneAuthorizationAtATime` in `a2a/authcallout`, which makes the
TokenReview slow and observes that no two overlap. It is adequate for the connection rate
this stage has - connections are rare compared to messages - and it is the first thing to
look at if a fleet reconnecting at once is slow to come back. Raising it means handling
each request in its own goroutine with a bound, which is a change to make against a
measurement rather than in advance of one.

## Observability and audit

**Audit.** The retained stream is the audit substrate, not an audit log - a replayable
stream nobody can query is evidence in the same sense that a disk image is evidence. The
deployment's job is to keep the substrate intact and reachable:

- The stream is the **buffer and replay window, not the archive.** Nothing accumulates on
  NATS forever: W bounds what the bus holds, and long-term audit lives in the customer's
  log sink.
- An **audit exporter** binds a reserved durable `audit` consumer on each message stream
  and writes envelopes to the sink - Cloud Logging on GKE, pluggable elsewhere (stock
  Kubernetes stays a hard requirement). Its acks track its own progress and delete
  nothing; limits retention means cleanup is W's job, not the exporter's. Deliberately no
  purge-on-export: the window is what everyone else replays, and an exporter that deletes
  is an exporter that can destroy evidence.
- **Exporter lag has two data-loss horizons, and the alert watches both.** The age
  horizon: backlog older than W dies by retention. The byte horizon: under a flood,
  `discard: old` deletes by byte pressure _before_ age - so an operator must never be
  told W is the only thing that can delete evidence. Lag is a first-class alert on
  whichever horizon is nearer: backlog age approaching W, or stream bytes approaching
  `max_bytes`.
- The audit path is read-only by construction, and "read-only" means what the
  JetStream tax above establishes it can mean: the exporter's user publishes nothing
  onto the A2A subjects, and holds no grant that can destroy evidence - no purge, no
  stream or message delete, no consumer delete beyond its own. It does hold the
  client grants reading requires, because reading a stream is not a subscribe-only
  act: the reserved durable `audit` consumer is created through `$JS.API`, and its
  acks are publishes to `$JS.ACK`. A user rendered from a literal no-publish reading
  cannot create its consumer, and would redeliver forever if it somehow had one -
  its own lag alerts firing on a user structurally unable to make progress. Enforced
  at connect like everything else.
- The attribution salt the gateway hashes identifiers with is `SESSION_KV_SALT`, the
  per-install salt the chart already provisions into `platform-agent-secrets` for the
  shipped attribution path - not a new secret this deployment mints. Replicas must
  read that one value or the pseudonyms on the stream stop joining, to each other and
  to session metadata. The gateway design owns the rule and why a second salt is worse
  than no salt.
- W stays a tenancy decision as well as a cost one - the bus holds labelled content at rest
  for the whole window.

**Tracing.** Trace context and the correlation identifier travel in the message envelope,
next to the capability identifier - the payload spec owns those fields. What this layer
owes: the client library creates publish and consume spans carrying that context, so one
trace spans chat ingress, every hop, and whatever the hop did. The server does not
participate in traces and does not need to.

**Metrics.** Standard server metrics via the Prometheus exporter. Beyond that, per-consumer
health is a first-class signal: `num_pending`, ack-pending depth, and delivery-binding
freshness, per stream, exported. A connection can be perfectly healthy at the TCP level
while its consumer is deaf (see the next section), and the metrics have to be able to say
so.

The starting alert set, so 3 AM triage has named invariants rather than vibes (dev
defaults; the numbers are tunable, the invariants are not):

| Alert                    | Threshold                             | Severity |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------- |
| `AuditExporterLagAge`    | backlog age > 4h (vs W=72h)           | Critical |
| `AuditExporterLagBytes`  | stream bytes > 80% of `max_bytes`     | Critical |
| `ProfileDispatchBacklog` | > 20 pending for > 15m on one profile | Warning  |
| `ConsumerUnackedStalled` | > 0 stalled for > 10m                 | Warning  |
| `AuthCalloutErrorRate`   | > 1%                                  | Critical |

## Client resilience contract

These are **requirements on the stage 1 client library, not advice.** The motivating
incident: a client wrapper in a lab deployment mishandled a routine server restart and
spent two days silently unable to receive directed tasks, with the process up and
TCP-level health checks green. The customer restarts NATS as a routine operation,
so a client that deadlocks on restart is a support ticket generator that scales with the
number of installs.

The requirements are stated as properties. The evidence behind them is nats-py-specific;
whatever language the stage 1 library lands in, the error taxonomy maps per client library
and the property is what conformance tests.

- **NR-1: Distinguish terminal from transient.** The library MUST branch on
  terminal connection close (rebuild the client and re-subscribe) vs transient reconnect
  (wait for the underlying library, tear nothing down). Test: induce each state; assert
  the two paths are taken.
- **NR-2: Rebuild, never retry into a dead context.** On terminal close the library MUST
  construct a fresh client, re-establish JetStream, and re-subscribe to the durable. It
  MUST NOT retry subscribe or consumer-delete calls on objects bound to the dead
  connection. Test: force terminal close; assert no call is issued against the old client
  object after the state is entered.
- **NR-3: Connection callbacks registered and logged.** Closed, disconnected, reconnected
  and error callbacks MUST all be registered, and each event logged with the server error
  that triggered it. In the worked example none were registered, so the error that flipped
  the client to terminal close was never captured and the root cause is unrecoverable.
  Test: assert all four are registered at construction; assert a forced disconnect produces
  the log line.
- **NR-4: Recreate-or-bind is an explicit decision.** After reconnect the library MUST
  explicitly either bind to the stored delivery subject or recreate the consumer with a
  fresh inbox. Relying on the client library's undocumented drift behavior is forbidden.
  Test: code inspection plus a restart test asserting the chosen path executes.
- **NR-5: Consumer health beyond TCP.** The library MUST expose consumer binding state and
  pending-message depth as metrics, and the component's health check MUST incorporate them.
  "TCP is up" is not health. Test: orphan the consumer; assert the health check fails
  while TCP remains connected.
- **NR-6: Jittered backoff on every connection attempt.** The library MUST apply
  randomized exponential backoff with full jitter to connection and reconnection
  attempts. A NATS or callout restart otherwise turns every client into one synchronized
  thundering herd against the callout service and the API server behind its TokenReviews.
  Test: force a reconnect storm across N clients; assert attempt timestamps spread rather
  than align.

## Conformance

The incident's conformance assertion, carried verbatim, goes into the stage 1 library's
test suite:

> **"a NATS client survives a server restart and resumes delivery without process restart."**

Per the negative-test discipline, the test proves the property, not the wording: kill the
connection at the transport level (not a clean drain), then assert the wrapper
re-establishes, the durable consumer is re-bound and delivering within a timeout, and the
reconnect event was logged. A test that would pass against "uses nats-py" is the wrong
test.

Two deployment-side assertions belong in the same suite:

1. A connection whose user lacks publish permission on subject S is refused by the server
   at connect/publish time. The message is never readable by any consumer.
2. A message that has been delivered and acked is still replayable from the stream within
   the retention window.

Both run against `kind`.

## Open questions

- ~~**Retention window W.**~~ Decided 8/24: the placeholders are the dev defaults - 72h
  task events, 30d journals, no age limit on state. The GA number is escalated to
  product; it is a tenancy call, not ours to guess.
- ~~**Who owns the audit exporter.**~~ Decided 8/24: stage 2, landing with the parity
  suite - that is when there is evidence worth archiving. Stage 1 ships the reserved
  consumer only. Owner assigned when stage 2 staffs.
- **Which server error flips a client to terminal close** rather than transient reconnect is
  unconfirmed - the worked example never logged it. NR-3 closes this for the future and the
  uncertainty does not change NR-1 or NR-2.
- **The origin refusal states its reason only in the pod log.** `fetchOriginAtSeq` names both
  sequences and exits; the sweep then closes the task with the supervisor's generic note, so a
  permanent, deterministic failure reaches its requester with no cause attached. The worker
  does not publish its own terminal here because the adapter learns `contextId` and
  `correlationId` from the origin envelope and nowhere else, and that assignment is downstream
  of the refusal - a wiring gap in the adapter, not missing information. The ids are on the
  pod object already: the spawner writes `a2a.kubeagents.dev/context-id` and
  `…/correlation-id` as annotations on every session pod, and the supervisor's sweep reads
  both back off the pod when it closes an orphan. Closing this is a downward-API `fieldRef`
  on those two annotations, beside the `metadata.name` one that env block already carries -
  not new plumbing from the gateway. Deferred because the branch needs the submission evicted
  before the pod's first fetch, which is the 4096-message shape above. Unowned.
- **Sizing.** TBD: message rates per stream class once the payload spec settles, and PV
  sizing from W times those rates.
