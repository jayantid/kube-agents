# Mode switch: `spec.mode`

- **Author:** [@bnaylor]
- **Date:** 2026-08-24
- **Status:** merged design of record; the switch itself (enum, helper pair, skew path, managed-`.env` pin) is implemented in the operator, and the NATS/gateway render, the agent-side bus surface and session-pod spawning it gates are implemented at playground posture

## Purpose

Stage 1 lands the new stack dark: the NATS component, the A2A gateway skeleton, and the
client library all ship in the repo disabled. This spec defines the one switch that turns
them on. There is no feature-flag framework in this codebase, and this doc is not the
excuse to build one - the mechanism is one optional CRD field and one helper.

## The field

One optional enum on `PlatformAgentSpec`, next to `Harness` and `Integration`:

```go
// Mode selects which component stack the operator renders.  "today" is the
// current architecture.  "next" additionally renders the NATS and A2A
// gateway components, which are otherwise dark.  Absent means "today".
// +kubebuilder:validation:Enum=today;next
// +optional
Mode *string `json:"mode,omitempty"`
```

`mode: next` is a dev toggle, not a supported configuration. Same shape as the other
opt-in toggles on this CRD: optional pointer field, nil-safe helper, deliberately not
surfaced in the Helm chart. Naming note: the CRD already has a `mode` field on the
Google Chat integration spec (display verbosity, `spec.integration.googleChat.mode`).
Different path, no schema collision - named here so nobody conflates them.

## The helper

All reads go through one module. Nothing touches `Spec.Mode` outside it - not the rest
of the operator, and especially not agent-side code (below). The module exposes a pair:

```go
// resolveMode validates the spec's mode.  Absent is (ModeToday, nil).  A value
// this binary does not recognize returns an error - the reconciler's cue to go
// Degraded rather than silently render something else.
func resolveMode(agent *agentv1alpha1.PlatformAgent) (Mode, error)

// renderMode reports the mode for one component.  Nil-safe and fail-closed:
// absent or unrecognized is ModeToday.  For call sites past the reconciler's
// validation gate, which only need the answer.
func renderMode(agent *agentv1alpha1.PlatformAgent, component string) Mode
```

The reconciler calls `resolveMode` once at the top and handles the error (below);
everything downstream uses `renderMode`, with one deliberate carve-out defined with
the skew behavior below: the agent's A2A surface takes its skew answer from the
reconciler's error handling, not from `renderMode` - fail-closed rendering at those
call sites would tear down a live bus. Without the pair, fail-closed and
Degraded-on-skew are mutually exclusive - a single helper that maps unrecognized to
`ModeToday` leaves the reconciler no way to notice the skew without reading `Spec.Mode`
itself. Fail-closed here means the dark stack stays dark. The `component` argument is
ignored today - `renderMode` returns the global mode regardless. It exists so that
per-feature graduation (sketched below) changes the helper and not the call sites.

**An unrecognized value is refused, not swallowed.** Enum validation rejects bad values
at admission, so the only way `resolveMode` sees one is version skew - a newer CRD adds a
third mode, an older operator binary reads it. Silently rendering `today` at that point means
the cluster runs something other than what the spec asks, with nothing in
`kubectl describe` to say so. Instead the reconciler goes Degraded through the existing
`updateStatusDegraded` path with a named reason, `ModeNotRecognized`, keeps rendering
today's stack, and requeues. It reaches Degraded by a different route from
`RuntimeClassNotFound`, and the difference is the point: that check returns early, so
nothing downstream of it renders, while the mode check is evaluated at the top and its
error CARRIED - every render step still runs, including the workload, and Degraded is
reported at the end instead of Ready. A skew that returned early would neither pin the
managed `.env` nor move the config hash, leaving the running fleet on `next` behavior
with only a status message to say otherwise. And the
two layers the mode touches are split deliberately on skew. The mode DELIVERED to the
agent fails closed: the managed `.env` pins `today`, the config hash moves, and the
fleet rolls to today's behavior - the skill is withdrawn, which is what fail-closed
means. The RENDERED surface is preserved, and not by accident of the helper contract:
`renderMode`'s fail-closed answer would stop emitting the bus env and the egress
rule, and this operator deletes policies it stops rendering - so the reconciler, the
one place that sees the skew through `resolveMode`'s error, arms the preservation
carve-out named in the helper section, and the A2A objects and the agent's bus
surface (container-env credentials, the 4222 egress rule) render through the skew
rather than drop. The preservation matters most on the `next` side: "fail closed to
today" must not mean "clean up next," or a one-version operator rollback against a
live `next` install kills the bus while dutifully reporting Degraded. The behavior
rollout does replace the agent pods; what preservation guarantees is that the
replacements keep the credential and the route, so the bridge reconnects instead of
hanging at the dial. Found live during stage 1 bring-up (8/26).

A deliberate flip back to `today` is the other half, and it does clean up: the A2A stack
is torn down, with two objects kept so a later flip forward reuses them. The bus creds
Secret `<agent>-a2a-nats-creds` stays, because re-enabling `next` must not re-roll the
credentials. The JetStream PVC `data-<agent>-a2a-nats-0` stays, because flipping a mode
is not license to destroy the file store. `hack/rollback-roundtrip.sh` checks both
against a live install: it flips `next` to `today` and back, asserts the two keep their
UIDs and the agent answers on each side, and the next lane runs it after its matrix.

## What the operator renders

- `today`: exactly what it renders now. A normal install cannot tell this feature exists
  from what the operator RENDERS. Admission is the exception, and deliberately: the
  reservations that keep a user-authored volume from carrying the bus credential are not
  mode-gated, so a CR that names `a2a-bus-token` or sources the bus's audience or Secrets
  is refused under `today` too. The two source refusals name the bus in the message, and so does the
  reserved-name refusal on a container's `volumeMounts` -- it says the volume is rendered
  for a single container. The one on the volume itself only echoes the name back, which is
  thinner than it should be for an admin who has never heard of `a2a-bus-token`. Gating them would let an
  install store such a volume under `today` and then flip to `next`, where the render
  strips it silently and the author never hears anything. A reservation that only starts
  reserving once the thing exists is not a reservation.
- `next`: everything above, plus the NATS component and the gateway skeleton. Next is
  additive - today's path keeps running until stage 4 starts retiring pieces - with one
  exception: Google Chat, which `next` moves from the Hermes platform to the A2A gateway
  (`spec-chatops-gateway.md`, "Coexistence is by mode").

One thing `next` does not ship: long-term audit. The stream is a 72h ring buffer and
the audit exporter is stage 2 scope, so `next` has no archive - the NATS spec's audit
section describes the design, not what this toggle turns on. Dev posture; don't run
traffic that matters on it and expect audit to exist.

The operator also writes the mode into the managed settings it already renders, as a
single key: `KUBEAGENTS_MODE`. (Amended 8/26: the draft said
`reconcileSettingsConfigMap`, but the surface with env semantics and agent-write
protection is the managed `.env` - `renderManagedEnv`, applied last, refused by
`save_env_value` - so the key rides that and the config-hash rollout annotation. The
agent cannot fake its own mode, which the draft's route would not have given.) That is
the only way the mode reaches the agent runtime.

A mode change is a rollout, not a hot reload. Kubernetes does not restart running pods
when a ConfigMap changes, so the operator stamps the rendered config's hash onto the
agent pod template (the `kubeagents.x-k8s.io/config-hash` annotation, which already
covers the ConfigMap carrying the managed `.env`) - flipping the mode rolls the Deployment,
and no agent keeps running in a mode the spec no longer asks for. Without the stamp,
`mode: next` would produce a silent split-brain: NATS up, the running fleet still on
today's path until something happens to kill its pods.

## Agent-side rule

Agent-side code asks one helper in the shared settings module - `runtime_mode.is_next()`
or equivalent - and that helper reads the managed key. No component reads its own env
var. A grep for `KUBEAGENTS_MODE` should hit exactly two places: the operator builder
that writes it and the helper that reads it. A third hit is a review comment.

"What mode am I in" gets one answer per agent, computed in one place. This also means the
delivery mechanism can change later without touching call sites.

## Not in the Helm chart

The chart does not template `mode` until graduation (stage 4, when `next` becomes the
default posture). Until then, flipping it is a `kubectl patch` on the PlatformAgent CR.
Helm 3's three-way merge leaves fields the chart never sets alone, so a patched mode
should survive chart upgrades.

## Switches inside `next`

The A2A gateway's inject door (`spec-chatops-gateway.md`, "The test backend") renders only
when the OPERATOR carries `A2A_INJECT_BACKEND=true`, on top of `spec.mode: next`, and its A2A
door for agent callers (`spec-chatops-gateway.md`, "The A2A door") only under
`A2A_AGENT_DOOR=true`, the same way. That is not a
second mode mechanism and does not belong in the field this document defines. The door takes the
principal it acts as out of a request body, so a CRD field would put "render the eval door" in
the API a cluster's owner edits and the operator would be obliged to honour it. Whether an
install is an eval install is a property of who deployed the operator, which is where the A2A
image overrides are already decided. The operator's render tests check that the flag unset
renders no part of the door, and the conformance suite that every render site consults the flag
and that the flag is not a CRD field.

A second switch of the same kind: `A2A_SESSION_CLUSTER_VIEW=true` on the operator, on top of
`spec.mode: next`, gives the session pods the gateway spawns a temporary read-only view of the
clusters. The operator names the session ServiceAccount on the credential broker's allowed
callers, renders a session audience the broker maps to a role that reaches the exec route for
`kubectl` and `gcloud` only, binds the two so that ServiceAccount may present only that audience
and no other caller may present it, opens the broker's ingress and the session pod's egress to each
other, and tells the gateway, whose spawner projects the audience-bound token and enables the
worker's shell. The session ServiceAccount gains no RBAC in either state; `kubectl` runs in the
broker, read-only in verbs, and with the broker's permissions: under a `custom` permission set
with an admin role the broker's allowlist is the only control and `kubectl get secret` returns
data, as
[credential isolation](../site/src/content/docs/reference/credential-isolation.md#pod-anatomy)
says of the platform agent. A session holds at most `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_SESSION_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMMANDS` broker commands at once (default 2; the operator's `spec.deployment.env` reaches it), so a conversation cannot take the whole command pool from the platform agent's shell. Operator-level for the reason above: the pod executes model output, and
widening its fence is a property of who deployed the operator. Under the flag a session reads clusters with the platform agent's broker scope, and the only gate
between a person and that read is the gateway's ingress allowlist. That differs from the design of
record ([architecture 02](../architecture/02-agent-personas.md) §2.4,
[03](../architecture/03-security-model.md) §4a, and "Sessions by default" in
`spec-chatops-gateway.md`), where a session reaches cluster data only through a gateway-minted
child task and the gateway checks the target agent's `AllowedUsers` against the requester first -
built now: a delegation to `platform` is checked against its `AllowedUsers`, but the view bypasses
that check entirely, so on an install whose CR narrows the platform agent's allowlist the two gates
no longer admit the same people. The view retires on the default flip (#2371); until then, on an
install whose operator has turned the flag on and whose CR narrows the platform agent's allowlist,
a person the gateway refuses a delegation to `platform` can still read its clusters through a
session's view.

## Per-feature overrides - sketched, not built

If a component later needs to graduate separately, the shape is a sibling map consulted by
the same helper, override beats global:

```yaml
mode: next
modeOverrides:
  subagents: today
```

Keys are component names (`nats`, `gateway`, `subagents`, `cron`). We are not building
this now - no field, no CRD change. The sketch exists to justify `renderMode`'s component
argument, and to stop a second mechanism getting invented when the need shows up. If the
need never shows up, `mode` stays a single switch and the map never exists.
