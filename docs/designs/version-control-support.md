**Scope:** what it takes for a kube-agents install to read and change a
repository, open and answer change proposals, and file and resolve issues on a
version-control forge that is not GitHub. GitLab is the worked example because it
is the one asked for; Bitbucket is the third and is designed for by not being
designed for. Issue trackers that are not part of a forge — Jira alongside
Bitbucket being the case that arrives first — are named and deliberately left
undesigned.

## Summary

An agent that manages infrastructure has to read and change the repository that
describes it. Prospective customers do not all keep that repository on GitHub,
and an agent that speaks only GitHub is an agent they cannot evaluate. **GitLab
and Bitbucket** are the two needed in the short term, and the list is not closed.

So version control and issue tracking become one abstraction with a modular
per-provider layer behind it. Four things carry it:

**A neutral vocabulary.** The caller is a language model, so the verbs are named
for the concepts every system shares rather than for one forge's spelling: a
change offered for review is a `proposal`, not a pull request or a merge
request. Both familiar spellings work as aliases.

**A seam at the credential boundary.** The agent sandbox holds no token, so every
call that spends one is brokered. The sandbox sends a repository and a verb; the
broker decides which provider that repository belongs to, calls it, and answers
in the neutral concepts. Nothing crosses the seam in a forge's own vocabulary.

**Only the remote half is abstracted.** All three target systems are forges of
_git_ — the version-control system underneath is the same one and only the
collaboration layer on top differs. Within that, only operations that cross the
network or spend a credential actually differ. `log`, `annotate`, `show`, `diff`
and file modes are git in every case, so they run natively in the sandbox on a
working copy with no origin and no credential, through no abstraction at all.

**One directory per provider.** Adding a system is a new package and one line in
a registration file. Two tests make that a build failure rather than a
convention.

The design was measured against the two repository-access designs this
repository already has, on identical probes: it answered the most probes, was
the fastest at every read rung and never took more turns than either, and —
unlike the design that ships today — stayed that way as the repository grew.
Writing costs it more turns than today's design does. Method and results in
[The experiment](#9-the-experiment).

## How to read this document

It is long, and it is layered so that a human reader can stop as soon as they
have what they came for. Each section goes a level deeper than the one before
it. An agent should read all of it.

This document describes the end state and the reasoning that fixes it. It does
not schedule the work: there is no delivery order, no step list and no division
into pull requests here, because which change lands in which release is a
question about the tree at the time, not about the design.

---

## 1. Why

### What customers are asking for

GitLab and Bitbucket are the two required in the short term, and the list being
open is what shapes the design rather than the two names on it. Self-hosted
GitLab and Gerrit come up often enough that a design which handles three by
enumeration and a fourth by rewrite is the wrong design.

That demand is the whole reason the work exists. It is worth being explicit that
nothing else is: this is not a response to a deficiency in how repositories are
reached today. The mechanisms this repository ships work, and one of them is the
baseline the new one had to match.

### Where GitHub is named today

The Platform Agent opens pull requests, resolves issues, publishes audit ledgers and answers review
comments. All of it goes to GitHub, and most of it says so in code. An install whose GitOps
repository lives on GitLab cannot use any of it.

The coupling runs through five layers, each with a different owner and a different cost to unwind:

1. **The consumers.** Six scripts call the forge's API to get work done. Three went through a
   provider abstraction — `pr_conversation.py`, `pr_triggers.py` and `github_scan_gate.py`, all on
   `forge.py`; three shelled `gh` directly — `resolver.py`, `submit_suggestion.py` and
   `audit_report.py`, two behind a private runner of their own and one inline. A seventh,
   `inspect_repository.py`, reaches a repository rather than an API, and does it through the
   broker's content-workspace route, which clones on the credential side and honours `--depth`.
   (`github_token_refresh.py` and
   `credential_proxy.py` also run `gh`, but for credentials rather than for forge work; they are
   layer 3.) All six go through the verbs, and `forge.py` with them — it holds typed values and
   three policy rules and no forge implementation. `inspect_repository.py` does not move: see the
   status banner.
2. **Repository identity.** `owner/repo` — exactly two path segments — was asserted in seven places
   across Python and Go, one regex expressing it copy-pasted into six modules. The widest assumption
   and the one least visible from any single file. Each language now runs its assertions through
   one parser ([Repository identity](#repository-identity)): `repo_ref.py` in Python, and in Go
   `repo_ref.go` behind the declared provider's `Resolve`, which is also the CRD's admission check.
3. **The credential plane.** The sandbox may hold no token, so every forge call is brokered. The
   broker's executable allowlist, its refresh route, the git credential shape it writes, and the
   token-minting pipeline behind it are each written for GitHub specifically — as is the FQDN
   network policy that decides where the pod may reach at all.
4. **The declarative surface.** The CRD declares forges and repositories in
   `spec.integration.forges` and `spec.integration.repositories` and labels each state-ConfigMap
   entry with its forge's provider, but the chart, installer and Terraform
   composition all carry GitHub App inputs, and GitHub is the only provider registered.
5. **The prompts.** Four `SKILL.md` files instructed the model in `gh` spellings; seven governance
   SOPs name `gh` to forbid it and call the artefact a pull request throughout. Three of the four
   are on the verbs; `fleet-audit/SKILL.md` and the seven SOPs are `audit_report.py`'s prose and
   move when it does.

Layers 1, 2 and 3 are worth changing whether or not a second forge ever arrives — each one removes a
duplicated parser, a silent fallback, or a hardcoded host. Layer 2's half of that is done: the
duplicated parser and `provider_for`'s silent fallback both went with the identity work. Layer 5 is
only worth changing for a
second forge, and so is what remains of layer 4. That split says what is worth doing. It does not say in what order, and neither does the
rest of this document — with one exception that is a property of the design rather than of a
schedule: the provider discriminator crosses a process boundary, so the Python reader has to accept
it before the Go writer emits it, or a valid CR reconciles successfully and is then rejected inside
the pod.

### Why one abstraction rather than three integrations

The alternative is to add GitLab and Bitbucket the way GitHub was added — each
one threaded through the skills, the scripts, the credential minter and the
governance procedures that name a forge. That multiplies by the number of
forges in every one of those places, and each new one has to be added to all of
them again.

An abstraction pays for itself the moment there is a second forge, provided the
seam is in the right place. Putting it between the sandbox and the credentialed
broker is what makes the rest fall out: the sandbox has no forge knowledge at
all, so nothing in a skill, a prompt or an agent's habits has to change when an
install points at GitLab.

### What is abstracted, and what stays native

"Forges of git" is the fact the design leans on hardest, and the split it
implies is sharper than it first looks:

- **Remote operations are abstracted.** Anything that crosses the network or
  spends a credential: fetching a repository, sending revisions back, opening
  and reading change proposals, listing and commenting on issues. These genuinely
  differ per forge — different APIs, different authentication, different nouns —
  and they are the ones that need a credential the sandbox must not hold.
- **Local operations stay native.** `log`, `annotate`, `show`, `diff`,
  `status`, `grep`, file modes, walking history: these are `git`, invoked
  directly by the agent, at full fidelity, on a working copy in the sandbox. That
  working copy has **no origin and no credential**, so the native command cannot
  reach a network even if something asks it to.

The practical consequence is that the abstraction is small. It covers the verbs
that had to be covered and nothing else, and the agent keeps the tool it already
knows for the majority of the work. A model asked to find when a policy changed
runs `git log`, not a protocol verb.

The same split is what keeps a repository's own contents away from the
credential. History moves as a git bundle — objects and refs, no `.git/config`,
no hooks, no remote URL — so the credentialed side never checks out a tree that
a repository or a sandbox authored. That property is described in
[The shape](#the-shape) and it is worth having, but it is a consequence of the
transport rather than the reason for the work.

### What already generalises

Two things exist and do not need designing again.

**The provider protocol.** `agents/platform/scripts/forge.py` defines `ForgeProvider` as eight
operations, normalises three GitHub-isms behind them (`can_write` as a boolean rather than
`author_association`, `supports_acknowledge` as a capability rather than an assumption,
`normalise_login` folding the spellings one account gets), and funnels every call through one
`call()`. `pr-comment-conversation.md` §3 explains each of those and why live validation forced two
of them; this document does not restate it.

**Provider selection.** There is one implementation of that protocol and it serves every forge:
each of its eight operations is a version-control verb, and which forge answers is decided from the
repository on the credential side by `providers/registry.py`. Adding a forge is a registration
there rather than a branch in a sweep — and, as [One provider implementation, not
two](#one-provider-implementation-not-two) argues, a second host table on the agent side would be a
second place to register it and a second answer to give the third forge.

A third is half-built, and the missing half is the one this design turns on. **A place to record
which forge a repository belongs to now exists.** The `managed_repos` state ConfigMap carries a list
of `{"type", "url"}` entries — `ManagedRepoEntry` in Go, `get_managed_repo_entries()` in Python — so
the discriminator is already per repository rather than per install, and already crosses the
operator-to-agent boundary.

Nothing dispatches on it, and the gap is already costing something. The operator only ever authors
`{Type: "github", URL: …}`, but it does not confine the field to that: `parseManagedRepoEntries`
unmarshals whatever type string the ConfigMap holds, the merge writes existing entries back
verbatim, and `GitHubSpec.GitRepo`'s own comment invites a cluster administrator to register
repositories in that ConfigMap directly. A `{"type": "gitlab", …}` entry therefore survives
reconciliation intact and reaches the agent — where `get_managed_github_repos()` keeps the `github`
entries and returns bare slugs. It logs the ones it skips rather than dropping them in silence, so a
repository an administrator registered is visible as unsupported instead of indistinguishable from
one that was never registered; it is still skipped, and the discriminator the administrator wrote
is discarded at the point of that skip.

Nothing downstream of it needs the discriminator. The sweep calls `forge.provider_for()` and gets
the one provider there is, and the host each repository is on is re-read from the repository itself
when a verb reaches the broker. So the missing half is upstream: `get_managed_github_repos()`
keeping entries whose `type` is not `github`, and returning a value that still names the host it
came from. A repository value that names no repository at all is refused before a round trip is
spent on it, and a host no forge module serves is the broker's refusal, reported to an operator as
`FORGE_HOST_UNSUPPORTED` — [Repository identity](#repository-identity) covers the parse behind
both.

### How this compares to what we have

The two designs it was measured against are the shared-volume credential proxy
and content passing, on identical probes and identical corpora: twenty
read probes at three repository sizes, plus a four-probe write rung. It was also
the only one of the three that never reached past its own interface. Full method
and results in [The experiment](#9-the-experiment).

Those numbers are a sanity check, not the justification. The justification is
the customer requirement above. What the measurement establishes is that meeting
it costs nothing in capability or speed — which is the thing that would have
stopped the work.

---

## 2. The concepts

The caller is a language model, so the verb names were chosen as a research
question rather than a naming preference: which words for these concepts is a
model most likely to already understand? Version-control concepts are stable
across systems and the spellings are not, so where the systems disagree the
neutral name is the command and the familiar one is an alias. Both always work.

### Where the names come from

The sources consulted were the systems' own command sets and reference
documentation — git, Mercurial, Subversion, Bazaar/Breezy, Jujutsu, Fossil and
Darcs — together with Eric S. Raymond's _Understanding Version-Control Systems_,
the _Version Control with Subversion_ book's terminology chapter, and
Wikipedia's _Version control_ article, whose "common terminology" section is
where the cross-system vocabulary is written down as vocabulary rather than as
one tool's manual.

For the collaboration half, which no version-control system defines, the source
is the cross-forge tooling: Launchpad's and Breezy's _merge proposal_, and
Jelmer Vernooij's `silver-platter`, which drives GitHub, GitLab and Launchpad
through one `MergeProposal` abstraction and is the closest existing answer to
this problem.

### Where this agrees with an existing normalised API

Google Cloud's
[Developer Connect](https://docs.cloud.google.com/developer-connect/docs/api/reference/rest)
answers an adjacent question — one resource model and one credential plane
across GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, self-managed GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud
and Bitbucket Data Center. Nothing here calls it, depends on it or is built on
it. It is cited because three of its choices are the same as three made here,
and independent agreement is worth more as evidence than a resemblance would be:

- **A repository is a registered object, not a string.** There, a repository is
  linked under a connection and carries its clone URI as a required field, so
  "which forge serves this?" is answered by looking the repository up rather
  than by parsing text a caller supplied. [Repository
  identity](#repository-identity) arrived at registration from the opposite
  direction — seven parsers that disagreed about the same string — and that is
  the stronger of the two arguments, because it is a failure rather than a
  preference.
- **The forge set is the same, and so is the split inside it.** Bitbucket Cloud
  and Bitbucket Data Center appear as separate connection types, each with its
  own webhook route, as do gitlab.com and self-managed GitLab. That matches what
  [`pr-comment-conversation.md`](pr-comment-conversation.md) §3 records from live
  validation: Bitbucket is two providers sharing almost nothing, not one
  provider with a flag.
- **Read and write are separate credential grants.** They are fetched by
  different calls rather than selected by a mode on a single token — capability
  is a property of the credential, not of the request that uses it.

The disagreement is one of scope rather than of shape: that API's public surface
brokers access to a repository, and the collaboration half — proposals, review
comments, issues — is not part of it. The verbs in the next section have no
counterpart there to align with.

### The vocabulary

| Concept                     | Command    | Aliases    | Why this name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Per-line attribution        | `annotate` | `blame`    | Mercurial's command is `annotate`; Subversion accepts `annotate` and `ann` alongside `blame`; Breezy's is `annotate`; Jujutsu's is `jj file annotate`. Git is the outlier in leading with `blame`, and it accepts `annotate` too.                                                                           |
| Revision history            | `log`      | `history`  | `log` is consensus across git, Mercurial, Subversion and Breezy. Fossil's `timeline` is the only dissent.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| The tracked file set        | `files`    | `manifest` | Mercurial has both and its own documentation prefers `files`; `manifest` is a Mercurial-internal noun that means nothing elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Text search                 | `grep`     | `search`   | git and Mercurial both spell it `grep`, and the Unix name is the one a model has the most exposure to.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Sending revisions upstream  | `publish`  | `push`     | Mercurial's phase model is where this is a concept: a _publishing repository_ is one that makes changesets public. `push` is the DVCS spelling, and here it would be a lie — this working copy has no remote to push to, and the word invites `--force` and an `origin` that do not exist.                  |
| A change offered for review | `proposal` | `pr`, `mr` | Launchpad and Breezy call it a _merge proposal_, and `silver-platter` settled on the same term for exactly this cross-forge problem.

`clone`, `commit`, `branch`, `diff`, `show` and `status` needed no decision;
they are the same word in every system that has the concept.

### Why the grammar changes between layers

One inconsistency is deliberate. The repository verbs are verb-first (`clone`,
`commit`, `publish`) and the collaboration verbs are noun-first
(`proposal create`, `issue list`). The grammar marks the layer: verb-first is
the version-control system, noun-first is the forge. A caller that notices the
difference has noticed something true about where the work happens — and about
which half varies between GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.

`create` takes `open` as an alias on both nouns, and that one runs the other way
round from the table above: every forge says _open a pull request_ and none of
them says _create_ one, so here the familiar word is the one a model reaches for
first and `create` is kept only because it is what the wire verb is called.

### Repository identity

`owner/repo` was asserted in seven places, across five modules and two languages, with no module
able to see what another was asserting. Every Python assertion now runs through one parser,
`agents/platform/scripts/repo_ref.py`, which returns a `RepoRef` carrying a host and an opaque,
arbitrary-depth path. It imports nothing outside the standard library, because the credential
sidecar validates across a trust boundary and must not pull in a module that shells out to
`kubectl`.

- `repo_ref.parse` reads a host only where the syntax states one — a scheme, or the SCP `host:path`
  form. The one exception is a schemeless value whose first segment is a known forge host, which
  does name that host: that keeps `github.com/owner/repo` working without misreading `my.org/repo`,
  a legal bare slug, as a host and a one-segment path. Every segment is checked for traversal and
  leading dashes, so the component rules that used to sit beside three of the callers are applied
  to all of them — including `credential_proxy`, the one that had none, which is where the
  behaviour actually changes.
- `repo_ref.github_slug` is where the two-segment rule now lives: a per-provider validation on
  GitHub, applied to a ref whose host has already been parsed.
  `gitops_workspace.extract_github_slug` calls it against `github.com` alone, because it reads a
  URL the operator registered rather than a git remote, and
  `github_token_refresh.github_repo_from_remote` parses and then requires a host, because git
  cannot produce an `origin` of `acme/repo` and accepting one would let a stray config value stand
  in for a clone URL.
- `repo_ref.is_github_slug` is the predicate form, and it is stricter than the depth check alone:
  the value must already _be_ the slug rather than merely normalise to one.
  `gitops_workspace.is_valid_repo_slug`, `credential_proxy.is_valid_repository` and the inline
  check in `github_token_refresh.refresh_git_credentials` are calls to it, and all three answer
  about a string their caller then passes on verbatim — so a predicate that said yes about a value
  it had quietly trimmed would be answering about a string nobody holds.
- `forge._parse_repo` was the sixth. #504 removed the `SETTINGS.md` path that called it, so it is
  deleted rather than converted; `provider_for` calls `repo_ref.parse` directly.
- `CleanRepoSlugWithOrg` in the operator was the Go one. It is now a deprecated wrapper over the
  GitHub provider's resolution: `repo_ref.go` parses the value with its host kept, and the
  provider refuses any host that is not one of its spellings — `github.com`, `www.github.com`,
  `ssh.github.com` — before its two-segment rule runs. `ValidateGitRepoURLWithOrg`, no longer on
  the admission path, goes through the same `Resolve`, so it and normalisation are still one
  rule, now a provider's.

The regex behind the bare-slug form used to be copy-pasted under its own name into `forge.py`,
`gitops_workspace.py`, `resolver.py`, `pr_conversation.py`, `audit_report.py` and
`submit_suggestion.py`, two of the copies already dead. All of them are gone.

GitLab projects live at arbitrary depth — `group/subgroup/project` is ordinary, not exotic. The
parser now carries one; what refuses it is the GitHub provider's two-segment rule, in Python and
in Go alike, at the points where GitHub is the provider. The difference is that the
refusal is a provider's, and states a reason, instead of being an invariant of the whole stack
expressed in four dialects.

A GitLab remote in any spelling is refused at admission, by the GitHub provider's host check,
because GitHub is the only provider registered. That inverts the obvious reading: admitting a
GitLab forge in `spec.integration.forges` is **relaxing an existing host check under provider dispatch**,
not adding a host check where a host-blind shape check stood.

**What remains.** The Python side has one parser and one set of rules, and the host survives the
parse instead of being discarded before the slashes are counted. What it does not yet have is
`RepoRef` as the currency between modules: every caller parses at its own boundary and hands on a
string, so the ref is a local variable rather than something passed. Making it the parameter type
travels with [the consumer migration](#the-protocol-past-its-first-feature), alongside the callers
that would carry it. One other thing is outstanding: the entry's declared `type`
reaching provider selection, which [What already generalises](#what-already-generalises) describes
and which needs a second provider before it selects anything.

**Where #1085 now stands.** [#1085](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1085) reported
that `repo_from_settings` resolved `https://evil.example/victim-org/victim-repo` to
`victim-org/victim-repo` with no host check, pointing the token refresher at a repository the URL did
not name. That function is gone. All four of the issue's examples —
`https://evil.example/gke-labs/kube-agents.git`, `https://github.com.evil.example/o/r.git`,
`https://evil.example/github.com/o/r.git` and `git@evil.example:o/r.git` — are now rejected at
admission, each by the explicit host check rather than by any slash count. The half the issue
deferred, "decide separately whether `ValidateGitRepoURL` should reject a non-GitHub host at
admission", has been decided the same way: it does reject one.

So #1085 is closed on both halves.

**A latent defect this removed.** `provider_for` used to have two ways of choosing wrong. It
selected by asking whether any key of the host table appeared anywhere in the repository string — a
substring test rather than a parsed host, so `https://example.invalid/github.com/o/r` selected
`GitHubProvider` — and it fell back to `GitHubProvider` for anything it did not match. Neither
picked the wrong provider, because no caller hands it a host: the sweep passes nothing at all, and
both of `pr-conversation`'s sources yield bare `owner/repo` slugs — `extract_github_slug` for the
discovered ones, `is_valid_repo_slug` for `--repo`. The fallback was the only branch taken, and the
host table was reached only from tests.

That was sound while there is one provider and a bare slug means GitHub. It stops being sound at
the second, because the table becomes load-bearing at exactly the moment a caller starts passing
hosts — and [the consumer migration](#the-protocol-past-its-first-feature) adds three callers that
resolve repositories their own way. The answer is not a better table on this side: there is no host
table on this side at all. `provider_for` parses the repository and refuses one nobody can read
(`RepoUnparseable`, reason `GIT_REPO_UNPARSEABLE`), and then hands every readable one to the broker.
Which forge serves a host is the broker's answer, and a host no forge module there serves comes back
as `UnknownForgeHost`. One of the two ends had to be the one that knows; a table here would be a
second answer for the third forge to disagree with. A repository with no host still means GitHub,
which is what the shorthand means until [the declarative surface](#6-the-declarative-surface) gives
the CR somewhere else to point.

### The vocabulary in prompts and procedures

Two kinds of prompt name the forge, and they need different work.

Four `SKILL.md` files instructed the model in `gh` spellings and called the artefact a pull request:
`fleet-audit`, `pr-conversation` and `submit-suggestion` under `agents/platform/skills/`, and
`gke-stockout-investigator` under `agentplugins/`, which reaches an install through the
`AgentPlugin` CRD rather than through the agent image and so is easy to miss. These want the command
behind a wrapper and the noun taken from configuration. `fleet-audit` travels with
`audit_report.py`, because the helper is what writes the ledger its prose describes.

The seven governance SOPs named `gh` only to forbid it, because `audit_report.py` owns their write
path. A prohibition has no command to wrap, so the SOP work is smaller and different: the nouns
("pull request", "PR body") come from configuration, and the prohibitions say to publish through the
helper and the version-control verbs rather than naming a forge CLI.
[The consumer migration](#the-protocol-past-its-first-feature) moves that helper; this step only
follows it.

`github-issue-resolver`, the skill a reader would expect on the first list, is not on it: its prompt
names no forge command — only its own `resolver.py` subcommands — and its coupling is entirely in
that script, which [the consumer migration](#the-protocol-past-its-first-feature) also moves.

`pr-comment-conversation.md` §6 already prescribes this for the worker skill, which is told to take
`forge` and `noun` from the card "so one prompt serves a forge whose users call them merge requests".
This design extends the same rule to the SOPs rather than inventing a second convention.

## 3. The seam

### The shape

History moves as a bundle, in both directions, and is never checked out on the
credential side.

`clone` asks the broker for a git bundle of the repository and unpacks it in the
sandbox, into a working copy with no remote. A bundle is objects and refs. It
carries no `.git/config`, no hooks, no remote URL. So every question about the
past is answered locally, by the sandbox's own git, at full fidelity and without
a credential anywhere near it.

`commit` runs in the sandbox too, against that copy. The revision has a real
parent and a real identifier before anything leaves the container, which is why
a branch of five changes stays five revisions instead of arriving at the forge
flattened into one.

`publish` sends those revisions back up as a bundle, symmetric with `clone`. The
broker fetches the target branch into a scratch repository, unpacks the bundle
beside it, and checks four things before it pushes: that the target still
contains the revision `clone` handed out; that the bundle carries exactly the
branch it claims; that its tip descends from that same revision; and that an
existing remote branch of the same name is not being clobbered. Then it pushes
the ref it fetched.

The first of those is `BASE_MOVED`, and its direction is the part worth
arguing about. It asks that the base be an ancestor of the target — not that
the target be an ancestor of the bundle's tip. The second direction sounds
stricter and is the wrong check: it demands that the bundle contain everything
on the target, which is to say that a topic branch be rebased onto the shared
branch's tip before every publish. Any push to the target by anyone between the
clone and the publish would then refuse a change that would have merged
cleanly, and the only advice a `BASE_MOVED` refusal can give is to clone again,
which is the one operation that discards the work. Base-under-target catches
the case the refusal is actually about: the target was rewritten rather than
advanced, so there is nothing to fast-forward from. An ordinary advance leaves
the base an ancestor and passes, and the change then opens as a proposal with a
base behind the tip — a rebase on the forge, not an error here.

It is also asked only on a branch's first publish. `baseRevision` means what
this bundle builds on: a revision of the target the first time, and the caller's
own last published tip every time after — and that tip is on the branch, never
on the target, so asking it of a second publish would refuse every one of them.
It is checked before the bundle is read, because a rewritten target is also why
reading the bundle fails: its prerequisites sit on the revision the copy was
cloned at, and if that revision is gone the unbundle refuses first and the
caller gets a git failure in place of the reason for it.

Ahead of all four it checks that the branch is not the target. Those four are
ancestry checks, and every one of them passes for a publish onto the branch the
copy was cloned from, because that is a fast-forward — which would leave the
default clone, edit, commit, publish sequence writing to the shared line of
development with nothing in the protocol objecting. `vcs.py` refuses it before
it builds the bundle so the message costs no round trip, and the broker refuses
it again with `TARGET_IS_BRANCH` rather than trusting the client that sent the
objects. That comparison alone is not enough, because `target` is the client's
field too: naming any other existing branch as the target would skip it and
leave two ancestry checks that a fast-forward of the shared branch satisfies.
So the broker also asks the remote which branch is its default and refuses a
publish to that branch outright, `PROTECTED_BRANCH`, whatever the request says
the target is. The client, which alone knows which branch its copy was cloned
from, refuses to publish that branch under any target, and tells the broker
which branch that was (`clonedFrom`) so the broker refuses it too,
`CLONED_BRANCH` — defence in depth for a confused caller, since a client that
lied would gain nothing it could not get by omitting the field. `advance` is
the one waiver of that last refusal, for the copy that was cloned _of_ a
proposal branch in order to add a round to it, and the broker does not take it
on the caller's word alone: it asks the forge for an open proposal whose source
is that branch and refuses without one. That is a bar rather than a proof — the
same caller can open a proposal with `proposal-create` first — but the bar is a
pull request under the install's own name, visible on the forge, and the
default-branch and protected-branch refusals do not depend on it. In addition to
the remote's default branch, the broker enforces protected branch policy on
`/v1/vcs/publish`: `main`, `master`, `production`, any operator-configured base
override (`CREDENTIAL_PROXY_BASE_BRANCH` / `GITOPS_BASE_BRANCH`), and any `run/**`
branch are strictly refused without a pull request (`PROTECTED_BRANCH`, status 409).
`/v1/vcs/branch-delete` refuses to remove any of them, whatever proposals exist:
outside `platform-agent/` as `BRANCH_NOT_OURS`, inside it (a default branch or
base override under the prefix) as `PROTECTED_BRANCH`.
Across the broker's other write doors, protected branch policy is enforced under
their respective protocols: the content workspace door (`/v1/workspace/*`) refuses
with `ContentWorkspaceError` (HTTP 400 `workspace.invalid`), and the command
execution door (`/v1/exec`) refuses with HTTP 403 `SECURITY_POLICY_BLOCKED`.

The scratch repository is never checked out. It is fetched into and pushed from,
and nothing materialises a working tree, so a `.gitattributes`, a hook, or a
`.gitmodules` among the incoming objects has nothing to act on. That is what
makes accepting caller-supplied objects at all defensible: the broker handles
them as objects, not as a repository it is standing in.

Nothing under the broker's scratch root outlives a request. Every route is one
request long, so there is no handle to leak, no tree to collide with another
caller's, and no cleanup an interrupted client can skip. Two mechanisms hold
that rather than one, and they cover different failures: each verb removes its
directory and its bundle in a `finally`, which covers a request that raises or
is refused partway through; and the scratch root is an `emptyDir`, which covers
the case a `finally` cannot — a broker killed outright, by OOM or eviction,
leaves nothing behind because the volume goes with the pod. No reaper sweep
runs, and none is needed for either.

One consequence is worth naming. An agent almost never wants a whole answer: it
wants the shape of one, then one part of it in full. Here that is `log --stat`
and then `show -- <path>`, both local, both git's own narrowing, and neither of
them a route. A protocol that answers from the credential side has to grow a
verb for each such narrowing and a cap on each verb's response, and a caller
that hits the cap gets a truncated list rather than a smaller question. This
design has no cap on a history question, because a history question never
crosses the seam. The one transfer it does make is bounded, once, at `clone`.

### The broker is already in its own pod

Everything above crosses as a payload rather than as a path, and that matters
because the credential broker does not share the sandbox's pod. It runs as its
own Deployment, reached over a Service, and the sandbox authenticates to it with
a projected ServiceAccount token that a TokenReview validates against the
audience `kubeagents-credential-proxy`.

That arrangement is the reason a verb protocol is the only thing that can work
here, and `credential_proxy_client.py` says so directly: it forwards no `cwd`,
because "the broker resolves a path against its own filesystem, and it has no
view of this one". A protocol whose operations name paths in the agent's tree
has nothing to name. These routes send a bundle, so there is no tree to point at
and nothing that needs to be co-resident.

`/v1/vcs/*` takes its place in the existing `ROUTE_ROLES` table alongside
`/v1/exec`, demanding the `shell` role — the same role, because the caller is
the same sandbox, and a route that demanded nothing would be the one gap in a
table whose point is that every route names what it requires.

### No shallow clones

There is no `depth`. This is a property of the transport rather than an
omission: `git bundle create` inside a shallow repository succeeds and writes a
bundle whose boundary revisions name parents the bundle does not carry, and a
clone from it fails with `remote did not send all necessary objects`. Naming a
`branch` is the size control that works, because it makes the broker's clone
single-branch. The two ceilings — `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_MAX_CLONE_BYTES` (256 MiB
of working tree) and `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_MAX_BUNDLE_BYTES` (64 MiB of bundle, both
directions) — say so in their refusals.

### One git in the sandbox

The sandbox has exactly one git: the real binary at `/opt/vcs/libexec/git`,
reached through a wrapper at `/opt/vcs/bin/git` that runs it with a
repository's hooks disarmed. There is no credential shim named
`git` beside it, and that is worth stating explicitly because the sandbox does
carry shims for `gcloud` and `kubectl`.

Two reasons, and either alone would be enough.

**Nothing the sandbox does with git spends a credential.** Local operations are
local by definition. Remote operations are not the sandbox's to make: fetching a
repository and sending revisions back are broker verbs, and the broker runs its
own git, in its own pod, over a checkout the sandbox cannot see. A shim would be
forwarding the one category of command that no longer travels that way.

**A forwarded git could not serve them anyway.** The proxy relays argv, and
git's state _is_ the local filesystem — `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push` each
need the previous step's bytes to still be there, and the broker's filesystem is
not the sandbox's. `credential_proxy_client.py` states the consequence in the
comment standing where a `cwd` forward would go: the broker "resolves a path
against its own filesystem, and it has no view of this one", so every forwarded
command runs at the broker's own workspace root. A forwarded `git commit` does
not fail in some subtle way — it operates on a tree the agent has never seen. A
shim on PATH is worse than no shim, because that answers a command with a
confusing success instead of a missing binary.

So `git` and `gh` come off the sandbox's shim set, leaving `gcloud` and
`kubectl`, which keep theirs because neither has a credential-free equivalent
and neither has anything local to read. `SUPPORTED_EXECUTABLES` in
`credential_proxy_client.py` and the shim symlinks in `deploy/sandbox/Dockerfile`
are the two places that say so. The image's smoke test asserts `gh` by absence
and `git` by what the name resolves to, rather than by which PATH entry wins.

The real git then needs to be reachable, and `/opt/vcs/bin` goes on PATH in the
two places a sandbox session's PATH comes from. The `SANDBOX_PATH` line in
`deploy/sandbox/entrypoint.sh` becomes the `SetEnv` directive in the generated
`/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` drop-in, and it has to be that one line — sshd keeps
the first `SetEnv` it reads and discards every later one whole. That covers a
non-login command. A login shell runs `/etc/profile` first, which overwrites
PATH wholesale, and Hermes takes its environment snapshot with `bash -l -c`; so
`/etc/profile.d/vcs-path.sh` puts the directory back, the same way the shim
directory's own profile.d entry always has. A missed prepend is a
`git: not found` on the first call rather than a silent forward, which is the
other thing deleting the shim buys.

The wrapper gives the agent's own `git` `core.hooksPath` pointed at an empty,
root-owned directory, `core.fsmonitor` off, `protocol.ext.allow=never`, and no
system config — the hooks, `ext` and system-config settings `vcs.py` gives its
own calls, plus `fsmonitor`. `-c` outranks every
config file, so a working copy that sets its own `core.hooksPath` — the step an
injected `CONTRIBUTING.md` asked for — still gets the empty one. It is not a
boundary, and does not claim to be. A repository-local `filter.<name>.clean`
still runs, because no `-c` can unset a name it does not know, and the binary is
one absolute path away. What contains that is the sandbox: an unprivileged user
with no credential and no transport to a forge.

The image's existing build guard needs no change to cover this. It already fails
the build if a bare `command -v` finds any of `gcloud`, `kubectl`, `gh` or `git`,
and its comment gives the reason in the same terms this section does:
`/opt/credential-proxy/bin` is not on the build PATH, so a hit "can only be
finding a native binary". `/opt/vcs/bin` is not on the build PATH either, so the
hardened git stays invisible to that lookup and the guard keeps meaning what it
meant — placement, not presence. Anything a bare lookup does find still got there
by another route and is still wrong.

A second guard proves the shipped binary cannot reach a forge. The control is
deletion, and it is deletion for a specific reason: inside the sandbox the agent
owns its own environment and its own config files, so `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`,
`protocol.<name>.allow` and `/etc/gitconfig` are all things it can override or
neutralise with one flag. Only the absence of a file survives that. The broker
can rely on the environment — `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` outranks every config layer
including `-c`, which is what makes it the boundary in `credential_proxy.py`
today — because the broker, not the agent, builds that environment. The sandbox
has no such advantage, so it gets the file-shaped control instead.

Git reaches a network three different ways, and each needs its own answer.

**Remote helpers are separate executables**, found on PATH by name, so deleting
them removes the transport outright. The four that dial a host —
`git-remote-http` and the `-https`, `-ftp` and `-ftps` symlinks to it — are
deleted from `/usr/lib/git-core`. This is the one that matters: https is how
every forge is reached, so removing it is what leaves a broker verb as the only
route to one. The guard fails the build if any is back, then runs an actual
`ls-remote` per scheme against an unroutable URL and requires git's own
missing-helper message in the answer.

The message is what carries the assertion, not the exit status. `example.invalid`
resolves nowhere, so every one of those URLs fails on an image that still ships
the helpers, and a guard that checked only for failure would pass there. A
`file://` probe runs last for the converse reason: a git broken outright also
fails to reach a network, and this is what says the disarming was surgical. The
guard these replaced asked `git <helper> --help`, which git rewrites to
`git help <helper>` and execs `man`, absent in `python:3.11-slim` — so all four
probes exited 128 and it passed whatever the image contained.

**`ext` and `fd` look like helpers and are not.** Their entries in
`/usr/lib/git-core` are symlinks to `git` itself: both are builtins, dispatched
from git's own table without the filesystem being consulted, so deleting them
does nothing. What stops `ext::` — which would run an arbitrary command — is
git's protocol allowlist, where `protocol.ext.allow` has defaulted to `never`
since 2.12, and the guard asserts that refusal by its own message rather than
attributing it to an `rm`. `fd::` reads a descriptor the parent already opened,
so it reaches whatever the caller could reach anyway and opens nothing new.

**`ssh://` and `git://` are dialled from git's own code.** There is no
`git-remote-ssh` to delete, and a default that an agent can turn off is not a
control, so these two are answered by what they need to run and by scope.
`ssh://` execs an ssh _client_, and the image ships none — the sandbox runs an
ssh server, because that is how Hermes arrives; nothing in it makes an outbound
ssh connection. The guard asserts the client's absence the same way it asserts
git's placement, which matters because it is the only thing standing between a
sandbox and a forge's ssh endpoint, and an unrelated package pulling in
`openssh-client` would restore that route silently. `git://` opens port 9418
from inside git and cannot be disarmed by removing a file. It is left, and named
here rather than in [What this does not fix](#10-what-this-does-not-fix),
because the anonymous daemon protocol is read-only, spends no credential, and no
forge in scope serves writes over it. It buys an agent nothing a plain outbound
socket would not, which is a question about egress from the sandbox and not
about git.

`vcs.py` runs that binary with `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`,
`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`, `core.hooksPath` pointed at an empty directory,
`protocol.ext.allow=never`, and no `origin`. The clone's only config is the one
git just wrote, so a `.gitattributes` naming `filter.foo.clean` finds no `foo`
defined and is inert.

### Forge neutrality

Nothing crosses the seam in a forge's vocabulary. The sandbox sends a repository
spec and a verb; the broker decides which forge that is, calls it, and returns
objects in the concepts above. GitHub's JSON stops at the broker.

That decision is also the security boundary, which is why it is made there. A
caller-supplied URL determines which host a minted credential is presented to,
so `Registry.resolve` matches the URL's host against an allowlist built from the
configured forges and refuses anything else outright — there is no default for a
URL with a host, because defaulting is how a token reaches a host nobody
configured. A host two configured forges claim is refused when the registry is
built, for the same reason. A bare `owner/name` means the install's one forge,
which is what every skill in this repository has always meant by it; with more
than one forge it names nothing and is refused, and the caller names the host. Once the forge is chosen, the clone URL is
composed from validated path segments rather than taken from the caller: the URL
decided _which forge_, and it does not get to decide the host.

The GitHub module reaches the API through `gh api` and never through `gh pr` or
`gh issue`. Those subcommands infer the repository from a `.git/config` found
above the working directory, which is the one file this design keeps out of the
credentialed process, and they format for a human. `gh api` takes an explicit
path and returns the API's own JSON, so the module is a REST client that borrows
`gh` for authentication.

Translation is where the judgement is, and it is the part a new forge module
will spend its time on. A proposal has three states — `open`, `closed`,
`merged` — rather than GitHub's two plus a nullable `merged_at`, because closed
and merged are different outcomes on every forge and a caller should not have to
know how one of them encodes the difference. An `[bot]` suffix comes off a login
here rather than at the caller; `forge.py` records what comparing an
unnormalised one costs, which was an agent that answered its own comments
forever. And `issue list` drops the nodes carrying a `pull_request` key, because
GitHub is alone in modelling a proposal as an issue — a translation that exists
precisely because the shared concept and the forge's model disagree.

### The protocol

Every route lives under `/v1/vcs/*`, and every one of them stands alone: it
names a repository, does one thing, and keeps nothing. There is no session, no
handle, and no state on the broker that a later call depends on — a caller that
crashes between two verbs leaves nothing behind to reconcile, and two agents
calling the same verb on the same repository do not have to be ordered against
each other. `clone` is the only route that hands back something durable, and it
hands it to the sandbox as a bundle rather than keeping a tree.

That is a constraint on what the verbs may be, not just a description of them.
It is why `publish` carries `baseRevision` instead of remembering what `clone`
served, and why nothing in the table takes an identifier the broker minted. It
is also why the routes take no lock at all. Each request gets a fresh directory
under the broker's own scratch volume, named from a counter rather than from
anything the caller sent, and deletes it on the way out; two requests share
nothing but that counter, and the counter's own lock is the only one in the
class. There is no shared tree here to serialise access to, and serialising
whole requests anyway would make a clone of one repository wait on a publish of
another for no property gained.

The rows down to `issue-create`, and the two branch rows, are the version-control skill's. The rest are the union of
what the shipped consumers do to a forge — edit and close what they opened, read
a proposal's commits, acknowledge a comment, keep a label in existence, ask who
the credential is and whether a login may write — decided by the callers rather
than by any forge's API surface, as [the migration](#the-protocol-past-its-first-feature)
requires. `issue-list`'s `query?` is free text each forge composes into
its own search grammar, and its `excludeLabels?` is what a sweep that must skip
its own claim marker asks with. `proposal-list` filters on the branches instead
— `source?` and `target?` — because "is there already a proposal for this
branch" is the question every write flow opens with. A comment carries `id` and
`kind` (`issue`, `review_comment`, `review`) because a proposal's discussion
spans three places on GitHub and the kind decides whether it can be
acknowledged; `capabilities` answers `acknowledge` for whether the forge
supports it at all. A comment also carries `bot`, which is the forge's own
answer to whether the author is an automation — not the login's spelling, which
is normalised before a caller ever sees it, and which is what keeps two agents
from answering each other forever. Where a view reads comments it says how many
it read (`commentCount`) and whether there were more (`commentsTruncated`): a
conversation read short and reported as whole is a decision made on half the
thread. `identity` is a broker verb
rather than a forge verb because half of it is a property of how the call is
authenticated — a CLI reads its login out of its credential store, an HTTP
client asks the current-user route — and the other half, `canWrite`, is the
forge's normalised answer to a question every forge spells differently.

`branch-view` and `branch-delete` exist because a branch name outlives its
proposal. A squash merge or a close leaves the source branch on the remote at a
revision the base does not contain — on GitHub by default, and on somebody
else's repository not a setting this install controls — so a branch cut afresh
under the same name does not build on it and its publish is refused as
`BRANCH_DIVERGED`. Every flow that derives a branch name from what it is fixing
(one name per workload, so a repeat alert finds the earlier pull request) meets
this on its second run. `branch-view` answers whether the remote holds the
branch and at what revision; `branch-delete` removes a spent one. Both are broker
verbs — the question is `ls-remote` and the delete is a push, identical on every
forge — but the delete's gate needs `proposal-list`, so a forge without it does
not list `branch-delete` in `capabilities` and is refused `FORGE_UNSUPPORTED`. The skill spells them `remote-branch view|delete`,
because `branch` is already the local verb.

The delete is held to exactly that one case. The branch must be under the
install's own prefix (`BRANCH_NOT_OURS` otherwise); it must not be protected, by
the rule `publish` applies (`PROTECTED_BRANCH`); no proposal from it may be open
(`OPEN_PROPOSAL`), and no open proposal may target it, since deleting a
proposal's target closes it (`BRANCH_NOT_OURS`); and its tip must be the revision some merged or closed
proposal from it carried (`NOT_SPENT`), so a branch that moved on after its
proposal closed keeps the revisions no proposal holds. The comparison is sound
only because GitHub freezes that revision when the proposal closes rather than
following the branch; a forge whose closed proposals keep tracking their branch
cannot serve `branch-delete` until it reports the revision at close. The prefix is a convention anyone who can push
can use, so the proposal that carried the tip must also be this install's —
opened from this repository by the credential's own login — and no proposal
from it may be anybody else's, or the delete is `BRANCH_NOT_OURS` too — a
history that fills the one page the broker reads (the largest one call
returns) included, since that page cannot show the rest; a
credential that cannot name itself leaves the prefix and the same-repository
rule as the bar, as it does for `advance`. That bar holds against a mistake,
not against the caller itself, which can open and close a proposal on a branch
with `proposal-create` to make its tip carried. It still cannot lose work that
way: the revision stays reachable from the proposal it opened, and a branch a
person proposed from stays refused. `revision` is the tip the
caller read, and the push is conditional on it: a sibling that published to the
name in between wins, and the delete is refused `BRANCH_MOVED`. A branch already
gone is answered `deleted: false`, not refused — the caller wanted it gone.
A remote that answers the delete with a refusal of its own — a branch rule or
hook, or a credential without the right — is `DELETE_REFUSED`, not
`GIT_FAILED`: it answers every attempt alike, so the name is not usable and a
retry is pointless.
The gate does not know which flow kept a branch on purpose: fleet-audit leaves a
closed remediation pull request's branch in place so the fix can be proposed
again on it, and that branch passes every check above. Keeping it is that skill's
instruction, not the broker's refusal.
`submit-suggestion prepare` makes this call itself whenever a spent proposal's
tip is not in the fresh copy, so no caller has to know which setting the
repository has.

Refusals carry a code: 501 `FORGE_UNSUPPORTED`, 413 `CLONE_TOO_LARGE` and
`BUNDLE_TOO_LARGE`, 409 `NOT_FAST_FORWARD`, `BASE_MOVED`, `BRANCH_DIVERGED`,
`TARGET_IS_BRANCH`, `CLONED_BRANCH`, `PROTECTED_BRANCH`, `BRANCH_NOT_OURS`,
`OPEN_PROPOSAL`, `BRANCH_MOVED`, `NOT_SPENT` and `DELETE_REFUSED`, 502 `GIT_FAILED` and
`FORGE_CALL_FAILED`.

A refusal the forge itself produced is translated rather than forwarded, and it
is written for the reader it has. That reader is a model choosing its next tool
call, so each message names the cause and then the action that follows from it,
which is the shape Anthropic's
[tool-writing guidance](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents)
asks for. The distinction earns its keep where the right action differs and the
symptom does not: GitHub spends HTTP 403 on both a missing scope and a throttle,
and an agent told only that the call failed retries the one that will never
succeed and abandons the one that would have worked in ten seconds. So 401 is
`FORGE_UNAUTHENTICATED` and says to stop, a throttled 403 becomes 429
`FORGE_RATE_LIMITED` and says to wait and to prefer one wide call to many narrow
ones, an unthrottled 403 is `FORGE_FORBIDDEN` and says retrying will not change
the answer, 404 `FORGE_NOT_FOUND` says that a private repository this install
cannot see answers the same way so absence is not proven, 422 `FORGE_REJECTED`
says to fix a field rather than repeat the call, and 5xx is 503
`FORGE_UNAVAILABLE` and says to retry the same call unchanged. Everything
unrecognised is still 502 `FORGE_CALL_FAILED`.

The table above is shared, and keying it on the status alone is _nearly_
forge-neutral. The exception is real and has to be designed for: a status can
mean different things on different forges. GitLab's 401 most often means its
stored access token reached its expiry after a year, which no refresh path can fix and
which wants an operator named rather than a retry; Bitbucket answers 401 for a
private repository it will not admit exists, where GitHub answers 404. So a forge
package may supply an override map merged over the shared table — a per-forge
dict of the few statuses whose guidance it disagrees with, and nothing more.
Recovering the status in the first place belongs to the transport, not to the
table: an HTTP client has it as an integer, and a CLI that prints `(HTTP 404)`
into stderr has to dig it out.

The forge's own first line rides along in `detail`, and `vcs.py` renders both.
They answer different questions — the broker's sentence says what to do, the
forge's says which field it rejected or that the branch has no commits — and
neither substitutes for the other.

Every credentialed verb makes its credential current before it spends it, on the
broker side and never in the sandbox — knowing that a particular forge's token
expires is forge knowledge, in the container that is supposed to have none of
it. It is not the broker's knowledge either. The broker does not mention
credentials at all: the transport asks the credential to make itself current
before a request, and the git runner asks it for config before an invocation.

That is one object per forge because it is one forge's answer to four questions
that are really the same question — how is this forge's token presented. GitHub's
is an App installation token that expires within the hour, so its strategy asks
the broker's refresh route before every verb; minting is idempotent and costs one
local process, and the alternative is worse than the cost. An expired GitHub
token surfaces as `Authentication failed` from inside the broker's own clone,
which reaches the caller as a clone failure and reads like the repository is
gone, so inferring expiry from a failure means the first verb after an idle hour
fails once for a reason the caller cannot act on. A GitLab access token has
no acquisition step at all, so its strategy does nothing — and says so by being a
strategy with nothing to do rather than by inheriting a no-op from a default
shaped around a forge that does.

A forge may not run a subprocess, and it does not have to: **the forge chooses
the strategy, the strategy names the privileged operation, the executor performs
it.** So no shared file names a forge, and nothing inside a forge package can
execute anything.

### Replacing `gh`

A forge CLI on PATH is the route out of a forge-neutral abstraction. Shipping
`gh` and naming it in skills binds an install to GitHub regardless of what the
abstraction says, so the collaboration verbs exist to make removing it possible:
`vcs.py issue list --state open --labels bug` replaces `gh issue list`, and
`vcs.py proposal create` replaces `gh pr create`.

In the sandbox that removal is literal. The entrypoint deletes
`/opt/credential-proxy/bin/gh`, and nothing else in the image supplies one, so
`gh` resolves nowhere in either session type. The smoke test asserts that by
absence rather than by which path wins, because a check on PATH order would pass
against a build that merely shadowed the name.

What settled that a shim on an obvious name has to go was measured on `git`
rather than on `gh`. An early pass of the read rungs shipped without the PATH
prepend that reaches the real binary, so `git` in a sandbox session still
resolved to the credential shim. The agent left the abstraction whenever a
question got awkward, and did so without reporting that it had: of those 60 read
probes, 8 were answered through the shim with no call to `vcs.py`, and 4 issued
a credentialed network clone through it. The pass was discarded and re-run with
the real git in place; the same probes on the same skill came back on the verbs,
3 of 60 off-route and no network clone. It is not that the verbs could not
answer. An abstraction whose bypass sits on PATH under the obvious name is one
the model will take, and `gh` is that same shape.

The honest counterweight is that `gh` was never observed being taken. Across all
60 valid read probes, with a working `gh` on PATH and unsealed, the agent made
zero `gh api` calls. Deleting it is therefore precautionary — it costs the
sandbox nothing, since no verb needs it — rather than a response to an escape
that showed up in the log.

Removal replaced a refusing stub, and the second measurement is why. The first
build shipped `/opt/vcs/bin/gh` as a script that refused and named the verb to
use instead, on the theory that a named gap is an answer a caller can act on
while `command not found` reads to a model as a broken image to route around —
the same argument `StubForge` makes about an unconfigured forge. The write rung was then run
in a fully sealed configuration, no `gh` under any path, and the theory did not
reproduce: the agent never attempted a `gh` call, emitted no not-found across
four probes, stayed on the verbs throughout, and finished faster and in fewer
turns than the same rung with the stub in place. The skill already tells it that
no forge CLI is needed or available, and that turned out to be enough guidance
without a binary to carry it.

What this does not remove is the dependency elsewhere. `gh` stays on the
broker's executable allowlist, because the GitHub module uses `gh api` as an
authenticated HTTP client. When this was written six things still named it from
outside the sandbox: the seven governance SOPs under
`agents/platform/governance/`, `forge.py`, and the `fleet-audit`,
`github-issue-resolver`, `pr-conversation` and `submit-suggestion` skills. Each
is a port, not a rewrite. `forge.py` was the load-bearing one: it is
already a provider seam of its own, it is what the four skills call, and
[One implementation, not two](#one-provider-implementation-not-two) is the decision that
it converges with `providers/` rather than becoming a second copy of it. Until
these are ported they do not work in a sandbox, and each is a place a second
forge would otherwise have to be added by hand.

A sanctioned `raw` verb — a forge-native method and path, passed through the
broker and logged — was the obvious way to keep an agent that needs something
unmodelled inside the boundary rather than out on the allowlist. It is not here,
and the measurement is why. Across 60 read probes the agent on these verbs made
no `gh api` call at all, and across the write rung run unsealed it made exactly
one, on the file-mode probe, unexplained in its answer; the sealed re-run of that
rung made none. All of that was with a working `gh` on PATH and every other route
it might have used still serving beside it. The escape hatch is a solution to a
demand that did not appear. Adding it would also put a forge-shaped hole in a forge-neutral protocol
and give a model a documented reason to stop at the first verb that does not
quite fit. If a real gap turns up, the verb list is where it gets answered.

## 4. The provider interface

### What a provider supplies

`Forge` is ten members. The rest of this section is why each is a member rather
than something the broker decides on the forge's behalf, and
[Modularity](#5-modularity) is why the boundary they draw holds at the third
forge.

| Member                  | What it decides                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `hosts`                 | which hostnames are this forge's; also what the credential allowlist is built from   |
| `parse(url)`            | the repository a URL names, and the only validator of that repository's shape        |
| `clone_url(repo)`       | the URL to clone, composed from validated segments                                   |
| `capabilities(repo)`    | what this install can do here, without spending a credential or touching the network |
| `verbs`                 | which of the collaboration verbs this forge serves                                   |
| `credential`            | the acquisition strategy, the API header and the git config — one object             |
| `transport`             | which transport the broker builds for it: `"cli"` or `"http"`                        |
| `for_config(config)`    | how many instances of this forge this install has: 0, 1, or n                        |
| the collaboration verbs | each describes a request and translates the response                                 |
| `error_overrides`       | the few statuses whose shared guidance this forge disagrees with                     |

Three of these are the modularity requirement rather than GitLab. `for_config` is
what lets `registry.py` stay ignorant of any particular forge. `credential` is
what keeps the next forge's token out of the credential proxy's own module.
`error_overrides` is what stops the first status whose meaning is forge-specific
from being absorbed as an `if` in a shared file.

`transport` is a declaration, not an implementation: the forge names what it
needs and the broker constructs it, which keeps the rule that a forge says what
to call and never how to execute it while allowing a transport that is not a
subprocess.

A forge that is registered but not configured is a `StubForge`: it parses its own
repository specs and answers `capabilities` with the specific gap rather than a
generic refusal. That matters more than it sounds — a caller learns what is
missing before it has written a revision it cannot deliver, and an install that
has not set GitLab up gets a named refusal instead of a confusing authentication
failure.

### `git`'s credential has no seam

This is the easiest of the four to miss, and it is worth taking first because
GitHub gives no hint that it is a question at all.

The broker authenticates to a forge twice, by two mechanisms:

- **The API**, in the collaboration verbs, through the transport.
- **`git` itself**, in `clone` and `publish`, which run `git clone` and
  `git push` against `forge.clone_url(repo)` — a plain `https://…` URL with no
  credential in it.

The natural shape of a forge interface supplies the first and forgets the second,
because on GitHub the second happens by itself. `github_token_refresh.py` ends
with:

```python
subprocess.run(["gh", "auth", "login", "--with-token"], input=token, …)
subprocess.run(["gh", "auth", "setup-git"], …)
```

`gh auth setup-git` writes a global git config entry making `gh` a credential
helper for github.com. So authenticating `git` is an _undeclared side effect_ of
authenticating the API, through a global config file, from a script that is not
part of the forge package. A reader of the interface cannot see why `clone`
works, and a second forge inherits nothing.

**So the credential declares git's config as well as the API's.**

```python
def git_config(self, repo: str) -> tuple[tuple[str, str], ...]:
    """Config keys this forge needs on the git invocations the broker makes
    on its behalf. Applied to those invocations only. Default is none."""
    return ()
```

This sits on the credential rather than on `Forge` — see
[Credentials belong to the forge](#the-credential-is-one-object) for why the
two halves are one object. GitHub's `BrokeredCredential` returns `()` and relies
on the helper `gh` installs, which is fine as behaviour and is now a thing the
interface says out loud with a docstring naming where it comes from. GitLab's
`StaticFileCredential` needs git to present a token that lives in a file, and
the shape of that answer is constrained by a property of git worth stating
before the answer, because it is easy to get wrong:

**`credential.helper` is run through a shell whatever it contains.** The leading
`!` is not what makes it a command — it only distinguishes "run this string" from
"run `git-credential-<this>`". An absolute path with no `!` is still handed to
`/bin/sh`, so a path containing a space breaks in two and a value containing `;`
runs what follows it. There is therefore no such thing as a "plain, non-shell"
helper value, and any design that puts an operator-supplied path into one is
composing a shell command whether it means to or not.

That rules out the obvious shape — an inline `!f() { … $(cat $TOKEN_FILE) … }; f`
with the token path interpolated — on two independent grounds. It would be a
command composed inside a forge package, which
[the prohibitions](#what-a-forge-may-not-do) forbid outright; and the
interpolation would be an injection point, since `tokenPath` is operator-supplied
CR content.

So the strategy chooses the helper and the executor applies it, which is the
same three-role split the rest of the credential plane uses. The helper is a
program at a fixed absolute path in the broker image, never one the
configuration names, and the value handed to git is that literal plus two
arguments the strategy has checked against a character set with nothing a shell
treats specially:

```python
def git_config(self, repo: str) -> tuple[tuple[str, str], ...]:
    return (
        ("credential.helper", ""),  # no helper another forge installed is asked
        (f"credential.https://{host}.helper", f"{TOKEN_FILE_HELPER} {token_path} {username}"),
    )
```

The program reads the token from that file when git asks, and writes the
username and the token to stdout in git's credential protocol, so the token is
never in git's argv, environment or config. The empty `credential.helper` first
clears every helper configured below it, and the second key is scoped to the
forge's own host, so git asks this program for that host and nothing else.
Applied through the existing `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` layer, which
`credential_proxy.py` already builds for `GIT_FORCED_CONFIG` and which outranks
system, global and repo-local config.

Three properties this shape has that the alternatives do not:

- **It is per-invocation, not global.** `GIT_FORCED_CONFIG` is one tuple applied
  to every git the broker runs, whatever it is running it for. A credential
  belonging to one forge does not belong on all of them.
- **The token is read from a file at use time, not interpolated into config.**
  A rotated Secret takes effect without restarting anything, and the token is
  not in the process environment, not in `/proc/*/environ`, and not in any
  argv the redactor has to catch.
- **It survives the token not being a bearer header.** GitLab accepts
  `username=oauth2` with the token as the password over HTTPS basic, which is
  what git does natively.

The alternative worth naming, because it is the one that avoids execution
altogether, is a URL-scoped `http.<url>.extraHeader` carrying
`Authorization: Basic base64(oauth2:<token>)`. It is data rather than a command,
git resolves it only for a matching URL so it does not follow a redirect to
another host, and it collapses `headers` and `git_config` into one value. What
it costs is the second property above: the token has to be rendered into the
config value, so it lands in the git child's environment and a rotated Secret
does not take effect until the next render. That is the trade, and this design
takes the helper because reading at use time is the property the rotation story
depends on.

### The credential is one object

This is where the requirement bites hardest, and it is the easiest place to get
the seam wrong.

Four things about a credential differ per forge, and the natural place to put
each of them is a different one:

| Concern                   | Where it wants to go                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| whether it expires at all | nowhere — it is assumed, by whether an acquisition method exists at all   |
| how it is acquired        | the process that holds the privilege, named after the forge that needs it |
| how the API presents it   | inside whichever client makes the call                                    |
| how `git` presents it     | a side effect of acquisition, per [above](#gits-credential-has-no-seam)   |

Every one of those is defensible in isolation and the set is wrong, because they
are four views of one question — how is _this_ forge's token presented — and
scattering them is what allows the fourth to become invisible.

The principle that resolves it: token acquisition is **a strategy selected per
provider, not a pipeline every forge is fitted into.** GitHub App tokens are
signature-derived and expire
hourly, so Minty exists; a GitLab access token is a long-lived string with
no minting step, so for GitLab there is nothing to acquire. An interface built
around acquisition makes the second forge implement a method that does nothing
and receive an argument nobody uses, and still leaves it nowhere to put the parts
that are not empty.

**So one member, which the forge constructs and owns** — the ambient credential
every credentialed verb makes current — with `read_credential(repo)` beside it
as the per-clone counterpart the broker asks for when the repository is a
registered context repository (§10, "Registered context repositories"):

```python
# providers/credentials.py — shared, forge-neutral
class Credential(Protocol):
    def ensure(self, repo: str) -> None: ...
    def headers(self, repo: str) -> dict[str, str]: ...
    def git_config(self, repo: str) -> tuple[tuple[str, str], ...]: ...
```

`ensure` is "make yourself current, if that means anything to you." Three
implementations cover both forges and, as far as anyone has proposed, the third;
the first two are ambient, the last is per clone:

| Strategy               | `ensure`                                              | `headers`                        | `git_config`                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BrokeredCredential`   | asks the broker's refresh route                       | none — the CLI carries it        | none — the CLI installs a helper                                                                                |
| `StaticFileCredential` | **nothing** — a long-lived token cannot go stale      | reads the file, sends the header | the helper pin from [above](#gits-credential-has-no-seam)                                                       |
| `MintedReadCredential` | asks the executor's read-only mint for one repository | none — the read path is a clone  | an `extraheader` on the forge's host, plus a `credential.helper` clear so the ambient helper is never consulted |

GitHub takes the first, GitLab the second. **GitLab's `ensure` is `pass`**, and
that is the point: a forge whose credential does not expire says so by choosing
a strategy that has nothing to do, rather than by inheriting a default from an
abstraction shaped around a forge that does.

Collecting the API header and the git config onto the same object as acquisition
is the load-bearing part. They are one concern seen three times — how this
forge's token is presented — and separating them is precisely what lets
`gh auth setup-git` become an undeclared side effect. One object owns all three,
and a reader of a forge package sees the whole credential story without leaving
the directory.

**Who does the privileged act.** A forge may not run a subprocess, and it does
not have to: `BrokeredCredential.ensure` POSTs to the broker's `/v1/forge/refresh` route with
the provider in the body, and the executor performs the privileged act. Three
roles, cleanly separated: **the forge chooses the strategy, the
strategy names the privileged operation, the executor performs it.** No shared
file names a forge, and nothing in a forge package can execute anything.

The broker does not mention credentials at all. The transport calls
`credential.ensure(repo)` before a request and the git runner asks for
`git_config` before an invocation. "Invoked as needed" is the caller's timing and
the strategy's decision, and neither is the broker's business.

### What the credential plane holds up

The governing constraint is
[`../credential-isolation-design.md`](../credential-isolation-design.md): the
agent sandbox receives no API keys or access tokens through its environment or
its filesystem, and no ServiceAccount token either — the one it does carry is
projected for a single audience the broker checks, and is good for nothing else. Every forge call is therefore brokered, and a
second forge is a change to the credentialed process before it is a change to
anything the agent runs.

Three parts of that process are forge-shaped, and the `Credential` object above
is what keeps each of them from becoming a name in a shared file.

**Acquisition, which is where two forges genuinely diverge.** GitHub App
installation tokens are minted from a JWT signed by the App's private key and
expire hourly, so an install runs Minty — the workload in
`charts/kube-agents/templates/github-minter.yaml`, with the KMS key and service
accounts behind it provisioned by `terraform/modules/github-minter`. That
apparatus follows entirely from App tokens being short-lived and
signature-derived. A GitLab group or project access token is a long-lived string
with no minting step, so for GitLab the KMS key, the signing service and the
`github-token-minter-config` policy ConfigMap have no analogue to build; the job
is storage and scoping. GitLab's token lives in a Secret mounted **into the
credential broker** — never into the sandbox, which the paragraph above forbids —
because it is the smallest thing that works and an operator can rotate it without
new infrastructure. OIDC token exchange is the better long-run answer for GitLab
and is deliberately deferred: it is a second design, and a first working install
does not need it.

**The privileged route.** A forge may not run a subprocess, so a credential that
needs one names the operation and the broker performs it: `/v1/forge/refresh`
with the provider in the body. The route is one route, not one per forge, and
carrying the provider as a parameter rather than in the path is what lets an
agent image and a broker image differ by a release without the refresher
breaking. A forge with no CLI reaches the same route the same way — Bitbucket
Cloud has no CLI at all, and the transport split above is what makes that a
choice of transport rather than a special case.

**Egress.** A pod that cannot resolve the host makes no calls, so the FQDN
network policy is part of the credential plane whether or not it looks like it.
The allowed forge hosts derive from the declared forge where the policy is
written: the operator renders it in
`k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go`, and no static copy
of it ships. This is also the clearest case for deriving rather than listing: a
self-managed GitLab is at a customer-chosen hostname, so no literal in this
repository could ever have covered it. GitHub's hosts stay in the list whatever
is declared, because a repository can be registered in the state ConfigMap
without being declared, and an invalid declaration should be fixed through
admission rather than by a pod that silently loses its forge.

What the derived policy protects is the **gateway** pod — the one it selects.
It does not reach the broker, which is the pod that actually calls the forge:
the broker's egress is open, and the sandbox is confined to DNS and the broker
by a policy of its own. So derivation keeps the gateway's allowlist correct for
any forge; it does not narrow where a brokered call may go. Whether the broker
should get an FQDN policy of its own is open — see
[Open questions](#11-open-questions).

### The request is a request, not argv

A verb describes the call it wants; the transport makes it. So what a verb hands
across is an HTTP request:

```python
def api(
    method: str,
    path: str,
    *,
    params: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    body: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    raw: str | None = None,   # a media type, when the caller wants bytes
) -> Any
```

This is worth stating explicitly because the obvious alternative is very
attractive and it is a trap. When the only transport is `gh api`, the cheapest
signature is `(method, path, fields: list[str])` where `fields` is that CLI's
argv — `["-f", "title=…"]` for a body, `["-H", "Accept: …"]` for a media type.
That is one CLI's command-line spelling crossing a seam whose entire premise is
that nothing crosses it in a forge's own vocabulary, and no second forge can use
it. A seam only one forge can pass through has not been shown to be a seam.

Two things fall out of the shape above rather than being separately argued.
`params` as a dict is what gets query parameters URL-encoded, where formatting
them into the path — `f"repos/{repo}/pulls?state={state}&per_page={limit}"` — does
not. And `raw` names the media type instead of smuggling it through as a header,
so a transport that is not HTTP-header-shaped can still honour it.

### The transport cannot be a CLI

Given a neutral request shape, something has to execute it. GitHub's is a
subprocess running `gh api`, which is there because `gh` is already in the image
for the App flow. GitLab's options are `glab`, or an HTTP client in the broker
process.

The rule this has to respect is that the broker owns process execution and a
forge only ever says what to call. That rule is right and it is easy to overfit
to — stated as "a forge supplies `api_command(...) -> argv`" it silently assumes
every transport is a subprocess, which GitLab is the case that breaks.
**`glab` is rejected**:

- It re-imports a problem the design already solved once. `GitHubForge` uses only
  `gh api` and never `gh pr` or `gh issue`, because those subcommands infer the
  repository from a `.git/config` — the one file this whole design exists to keep
  out of the credentialed process. `glab` has the same subcommands with the same
  inference.
- It is a second binary in the credential-proxy image, with its own auth state
  on disk, its own config file, its own update-check network call, and its own
  CVE stream — in the container holding the token.
- It buys nothing. `gh` is in the image because it was already there for the
  GitHub App flow. There is no equivalent debt for GitLab.

**So: an in-process `HttpTransport` built on `urllib`.** The broker constructs
it; a forge never does. It is the broker that owns the timeout, the response
size cap, the redaction of the token out of anything logged, and the mapping
from HTTP status to the shared error contract. The timeout is the request's, not
the call's: a verb that pages makes many calls on one request slot, and each is
cut to what is left of that slot's shared deadline, the bound the CLI path's
commands already share.

Two things this changes that are worth being explicit about, because they are
the cost side:

- **The broker process makes direct outbound HTTPS**, where its other network
  I/O is in subprocesses. At the NetworkPolicy layer nothing changes — egress is
  per pod, and `git clone` already leaves that pod for the same host. The
  gateway's FQDN policy picks up a self-managed host from the declaration; the
  broker's own egress is open, and whether to narrow it is in
  [Open questions](#11-open-questions).
- **Timeouts and output caps are not inherited.** A subprocess runner enforces
  both for the CLI path. `HttpTransport` has to enforce them itself, and a test
  has to hold it to that, because "the runner did it" is exactly the kind of
  property that quietly stops being true when the transport changes.

In exchange the token never enters an argv, an environment variable, or a child
process at all. That is strictly better than `gh`, and it is worth noting that
migrating `GitHubForge` onto `HttpTransport` later becomes a small change once
the App token is available to the broker directly — not proposed here, but the
shape does not foreclose it.

### One package, many hosts

`gitlab.com` and a self-managed GitLab are **one package**. The REST API is the
same `/api/v4`, the objects are the same, the token is the same shape. What
differs is the hostname, the network path to it, and where the token came from
— configuration, not code. Two classes would be one class and a copy that
drifts.

The consequence is that the set of forges cannot be a literal, because a
customer's `gitlab.acme.internal` is not knowable at import time. So the registry
is built once at broker construction:

```python
def build_forges(config: ForgeConfig) -> tuple[Forge, ...]
```

`GitHubForge` yields one instance when no forge configuration is mounted, or
when the configuration names a `github` forge, and none otherwise; a configured
host it does not serve is refused. `GitLabForge` yields
one per configured host, and none when none is configured — in which case
`gitlab.com` resolves to the `StubForge`, so an install that has not set GitLab
up gets a named refusal rather than a confusing authentication failure. The host
lookup `resolve` uses is derived from this tuple rather than from a module
constant.

Where the configuration comes from is
[the declarative surface](#6-the-declarative-surface). What matters at this seam
is only what the broker has to receive, in whatever form that surface renders it:

| Field          | What it is                                                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `host`         | the GitLab hostname                                                                          |
| `tokenPath`    | file the projected Secret lands at                                                           |
| `allowedPaths` | namespace prefixes this token may be spent on — see [The credential](#the-gitlab-credential) |

One caveat on hostnames, inherited rather than introduced: a schemeless
repository value names a host only when `repo_ref.parse` already knows that
host, so a bare `owner/name` resolves to the install's one forge (and is refused
when there are several), and an in-cluster GitLab
reached as `gitlab` with no scheme is read as a repository named `gitlab` until
the configured host joins the parser's known set. Registering it there is part
of wiring the provider up; the misreading is otherwise silent and confusing.

### Where the error contract splits

`errors.py` holds a status-to-guidance table — forge-neutral prose about what an
agent should do next — and `forge_error(status, detail)` builds a refusal from
it. Two things are deliberately _not_ in there, and both are places a
single-forge design would have put them:

- **Recovering the status.** `HttpTransport` has it as an integer. A CLI prints
  `(HTTP 404)` into stderr and something has to dig it out with a regex. That
  regex belongs to `CliTransport`, not to the error module, because it is a
  property of how the call was made rather than of what the forge answered.
- **Splitting one status by message text.** GitHub spends 403 on both a missing
  scope and a throttle, and telling them apart means matching throttle markers in
  prose. That heuristic lives on `GitHubForge`. GitLab returns 429 with
  `RateLimit-*` headers and needs none of it, and a shared module carrying
  GitHub's markers would be a shared module the next forge inherits through the
  front door.

One thing runs the other way. Throttling is worth counting and not only
refusing: an install running down its token quota shows up in the rate of
throttled calls well before it shows up as a turn that timed out. Those counters
belong to the broker, labelled by provider, rather than to each forge — a
provider that registered metrics of its own would be a provider able to extend
the shared surface, which is what [Modularity](#5-modularity) exists to prevent.
The forge classifies the failure; the broker counts it. What the counters are
named, and what scrapes them, follows whatever convention the platform settles
on and is not invented here.

### One provider implementation, not two

`main` already carries a partial provider abstraction, and it is worth naming
before this one is read as arriving on empty ground.
`agents/platform/scripts/forge.py` is agent-side: a `ForgeProvider` protocol of
seven read operations, a `GitHubProvider` shelling `gh` behind it, and typed
`PullRequest` / `Comment` / `Commit` values. It exists to serve one feature — the
pull-request review conversation — and it stops where that feature stops. That
is the state this section argues against; what it now holds is the outcome of
the argument, one `BrokerProvider` over the verbs.

The broker described here needs the same furniture on its own side of the
credential boundary: a provider protocol, a GitHub implementation, a host
resolver, an error taxonomy and a way to recover an HTTP status from a failed
CLI call — everything, that is, except the repository parser, which
`repo_ref.py` already makes one object for both sides. **That is one
implementation, not two.** Two copies is two places to add GitLab to and two
answers to every question the third forge asks. So
`providers/` is where both halves end up, and `forge.py` is folded into it rather
than left standing beside it.

Folding is the right word rather than "replacing", because neither side is the
superset of the other:

| `forge.py` contributes                                                  | The broker side contributes                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| typed values instead of raw JSON crossing the seam                      | `verbs`, and `ForgeUnsupported` → 501                       |
| agent policy on the value, not in the provider — `is_ignored`, `is_bot` | `capabilities(repo)`, answered with no token and no network |
| a `ForgeError` / `RepoUnparseable` taxonomy callers catch               | the status-to-guidance table                                |
| the wider verb surface the skills actually call                         | the seven validators                                        |
|                                                                         | `clone_url` composed from validated segments only           |
|                                                                         | the `Credential` strategy, and the package layout           |

The union is roughly thirty methods, which is unimplementable without `verbs` and
`ForgeUnsupported` to make partial support a first-class answer — and the eight
verbs the skill started with were too narrow to serve the other consumers. Neither can simply absorb the
other, which is why the shape above is designed rather than inherited from
whichever side happened to be written first.

That yields one constraint on what reaches `main`, and it is the only one:

> **The provider abstraction arrives on `main` in the `providers/` layout** — not
> in a flatter arrangement to be restructured afterwards, and not as a second
> GitHub implementation standing alongside `forge.py`'s.

Restructuring afterwards is the work nobody schedules, and a second GitHub
implementation is far harder to remove once merged than to not write.

The constraint is deliberately narrow: it says where the code lands, not what
order it is written in. `forge.py`'s two consumers kept working untouched until
they were migrated, so neither the abstraction nor the migration blocked the
other. The state worth preventing is the third one, where two GitHub
implementations arrive independently and each acquires consumers. That is what
the sequencing bought: `forge.py` now holds no implementation to be the second
of.

### The protocol past its first feature

`forge.py` serves two consumers — the `pr_comments` sweep in `github_scan_gate.py` and the
`pr-conversation` worker skill — and both are the same feature seen from its two ends. Everything
else is outside it: `resolver.py` and `audit_report.py` each carry a private `gh` runner of their
own, and `submit_suggestion.py` does not even have that, shelling `["gh", …]` inline at three call
sites. A second forge implemented against `forge.py` alone therefore buys a reviewer conversation
and no issue resolution, no audit ledger, and no way to open a change.

Migrating those three onto the provider is the step that makes a forge a class rather than four
rewrites. It was anticipated rather than planned:
[`pr-comment-conversation.md`](pr-comment-conversation.md) §7 names `resolver.py` as the module's
obvious next consumer while holding the migration itself out of scope. All three move onto the
verbs rather than onto `forge.py` — which is the same destination, since `forge.py`'s operations are
verbs now — and with `audit_report.py` among them the ledger is a forge surface a second forge
serves like any other.

The protocol grows to the union of what the four need. Beyond the existing seven, that is opening a
change (branch plus pull request), editing and reading one back, listing and commenting on issues,
and setting labels. The precise list falls out of the migration rather than being guessed here; what
matters to this design is that it is decided by the callers, not by GitHub's API surface, and that
harness policy stays above the provider. The existing split is the precedent: the provider answers
"what is open" and the caller answers "which of those are mine", so the branch-prefix and
`agent:ignore` rules are written once instead of once per forge.

Two provider shapes come out of the credential plane rather than out of this section: a CLI-backed
provider that shells a brokered binary, and one that speaks REST in-process. Both implement the same
protocol, and [the transport](#the-transport-cannot-be-a-cli) is where they differ — a declared
member rather than a subclass, which is what lets one provider class serve both shapes.

---

## 5. Modularity

Everything above is what the _second_ forge needs. This section is what the
_third_ one needs, and it is a different question. Bitbucket should cost less than
GitLab, not the same; the way that happens is that GitLab leaves behind a shape
Bitbucket fills in rather than a precedent Bitbucket imitates.

The requirement, stated so it can be checked: **adding a forge is a new
directory and one line in a registration file. It touches no shared module and
no other forge's code.**

The failure mode this is against is not exotic. A forge, its verb list, its error
parsing and the registry all fit comfortably in one module with the broker, and
at one forge that is the right call. At two it means the second forge arrives as
an edit to the first forge's file. At three, "who broke GitHub" stops having a
one-file answer, and by then the layout is expensive to change and nobody
schedules it.

### The layout

```text
agents/platform/scripts/
  repo_ref.py              # repository identity: RepoRef, parse — already on main, shared with the agent side
  vcs_broker.py            # broker verbs, clone/publish, scratch, routes
  providers/
    __init__.py            # the public surface: Forge, ForgeUnsupported, Registry
    base.py                # Forge ABC, ForgeUnsupported, StubForge, normalised shapes
    validate.py            # the seven validators
    errors.py              # the status-to-guidance table, forge_error(status, detail)
    transport.py           # Transport protocol, CliTransport, HttpTransport
    credentials.py         # Credential protocol, BrokeredCredential, StaticFileCredential, MintedReadCredential
    registry.py            # AVAILABLE, build_forges(config)
    github/
      __init__.py  forge.py  translate.py  errors.py
    gitlab/
      __init__.py  forge.py  translate.py
  testdata/
    providers/
      github/  gitlab/       # recorded API responses the contract harness replays
```

The split is by _who owns the decision_. `providers/` holds everything a forge
needs to be written against; a forge package holds everything only that forge
knows. `vcs_broker.py` keeps what is true regardless of forge — the scratch
tree and the counter that names each request's directory, the bundle size
ceiling, the route table — and contains no forge name at all.

Most of `providers/` is not new logic. The validators and the
status-to-guidance table are forge-neutral already, and repository parsing is
`repo_ref.py`, which sits one level up because the credential sidecar imports
it too; what the layout does is put the rest somewhere a forge package can
import without importing a forge. That distinction is the whole point of the boundary test
below, and it is why `errors.py` holds the guidance table but not the throttle
heuristics that read GitHub's message text: a shared module that keeps one
forge's heuristics is a shared module the next forge inherits through the front
door.

### Registration, in two levels

The tension: the registry should not know anything about a forge, but a
self-managed GitLab is not knowable at import time — there may be zero of them
or four, and their hostnames come from configuration.

Resolved by making the class, not the registry, answer "how many of me exist":

```python
# providers/registry.py — the one shared file a new forge edits
from .github import GitHubForge
from .gitlab import GitLabForge

AVAILABLE = (GitHubForge, GitLabForge)


def build_forges(config) -> tuple[Forge, ...]:
    return tuple(f for cls in AVAILABLE for f in cls.for_config(config))
```

`for_config` is a classmethod returning zero or more instances.
`GitHubForge.for_config` returns one, or none when a mounted forge configuration
leaves GitHub out.
`GitLabForge.for_config` returns one per configured host and an empty tuple when
none are configured. Adding Bitbucket is the import line and the tuple entry;
`build_forges` does not change, and neither does anything downstream of it.

`resolve` walks the built tuple by host and falls back to `StubForge` for a
known-but-unconfigured one.

### Where a provider's name is allowed to appear

One rule, and it is the whole of the modularity claim: **a forge's name appears
in its own package and nowhere else.** Not in the broker, not in a shared
contract module, not in another forge's package, and — with one acknowledged
exception below — not in the two files that decide what may run.

Six places would hold a forge name if nobody had decided otherwise, and each is
worth naming because each is a specific piece of the design rather than general
tidiness:

| Would name a forge                            | Does not, because                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| the registry of which forges exist            | it names classes and asks each `for_config` how many instances this install has, so a self-managed host never reaches a shared file                            |
| the code that makes an authenticated API call | the forge declares a `transport`; the broker builds it. A CLI is one implementation of that, not the shape of the seam                                         |
| the request the verbs hand to it              | it is `(method, path, params, body, raw)` — an HTTP request, not one CLI's argv with a media type smuggled in as a header                                      |
| the set of verbs `capabilities` reports       | `verbs` is a class attribute of the forge                                                                                                                      |
| recovering an HTTP status from a failure      | the transport does it — an integer for HTTP, a parse for a CLI that prints `(HTTP 404)` into stderr — and the guidance table keyed on that status stays shared |
| the code that makes a credential current      | the forge's `credential` does; the broker never mentions credentials                                                                                           |

The rule has exactly one acknowledged exception, and because a modularity claim
that quietly omits its own exception is not worth checking, it gets its own
subsection below.

### What holds the boundary

A layout is a convention, and conventions decay under deadline. Two tests turn
it into something that fails CI.

**An import-boundary test**, `ast`-parsing every module under
`agents/platform/scripts/` and asserting three rules:

1. No module outside `providers/` imports `providers.<name>` — only `providers` itself.
2. `registry.py` is the sole exception, and only for names in `AVAILABLE`.
3. A forge package imports only
   `providers.{base,validate,errors,transport,credentials}`, `repo_ref`
   and the standard library. Not the broker, not another forge.

Rule 3 is the one that matters. It is what makes "Bitbucket cannot reach into
GitHub's translation" a build failure rather than a code-review preference, and
it is the reason the shared modules have to be genuinely forge-neutral: if
`errors.py` kept `_THROTTLE_MARKERS`, GitLab would be importing GitHub's
heuristics through the front door and the test would not notice.

**A forge-name guard**, which the import test cannot catch: the string `github`
must not appear in `vcs_broker.py` or in any module directly under `providers/`
other than `registry.py`. An `if host == "github.com":` needs no import. This is
a grep, it is crude, and crude is the point — it is the check that catches the
special case someone adds at 6pm.

`registry.py` is carved out because the layout requires it to name every forge,
and a guard that red-builds on the reference implementation gets weakened in its
first week. It is held to the same standard by a narrower check instead: on every
line of `registry.py` where a forge package name appears, that line must be an
import or the `AVAILABLE` tuple. The name may be listed there and may not decide
anything there.

Both belong with the existing broker tests, and both are cheap enough to run on
every change rather than in a nightly.

### The contract test, parameterised

The verb tests are one suite parameterised over `AVAILABLE`, not a file per
forge. Each forge supplies a directory of recorded API responses — the JSON its
host actually returns for each verb it claims — under
`testdata/providers/<forge name>/`, beside the tests and outside the package the
images ship, and the suite finds it by the forge's name.

That inverts where the cost falls. A per-forge test file means holding a new
forge to the same assertions is a shared-test edit somebody has to remember to
make; here a new forge adds its recordings and the existing suite picks them up.
The same assertions about normalised shape, about `ForgeUnsupported` for
unimplemented verbs, about validators rejecting the same inputs, run against it
without anyone touching a shared test.

Fixtures rather than a live API for the usual reason — the tests run in CI with
no credential and no egress — and recorded rather than hand-written because a
hand-written fixture encodes what the author believed the API returns.

### What a forge may not do

The boundary is also a security boundary, and it is worth stating as a
prohibition because every item is something a forge package could plausibly want
to do:

| A forge may not         | Because                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| run a subprocess        | every control on what the credentialed process executes lives in one place, and it is not the forge |
| choose a scratch path   | path containment is the broker's invariant and is tested there                                      |
| set a timeout           | a forge could set it to zero and hang the proxy                                                     |
| bypass the size ceiling | the bundle limit is a resource bound, not a policy a forge tunes                                    |

The first row is the load-bearing one, and it is not a style preference. A forge
package is ordinary Python running inside the process that holds the token, so
nothing at the language level stops it from calling `subprocess.run` — which is
exactly why the prohibition has to be stated and tested rather than assumed. On
`main` today, `CommandExecutor` is the single point where every control on an
executed command is applied: `ALLOWED_EXECUTABLES` decides what may run at all,
an argv refusal list closes `--upload-pack` and `--receive-pack`,
`GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` pins the transports, `GIT_FORCED_CONFIG` outranks every
config layer, `GIT_EDITOR=false` closes the editor vector, and the timeout and
output ceilings bound the result. A forge that shells out directly is not
subject to any of them, and none of those controls would report that they had
been skipped. The allowlist would become advisory the moment one forge decided
it needed something the executor did not offer.

So a forge declares `transport` and returns a request; the broker constructs the
command and `CommandExecutor` runs it. The compressed form: **a forge answers
questions, it does not do things.**
`clone_url` returns a URL; it does not clone. `verbs` names what is supported;
it does not dispatch. A verb returns a request description and translates a
response; it does not make the call. Holding to that is easy while there is one
forge and a reviewer sees the whole of it; the split is what keeps it true once
the code lives somewhere a reviewer of the broker will not look.

### Why not a runtime plugin

The question was whether per-forge support should be a plugin: separately
packaged, separately shipped, loaded at runtime rather than compiled in. That
would let GitLab support be delegated to a different developer without them
touching the shared file set at all.

**It should not, and the reason is where the code runs.** The broker is the
process that holds the credential. Its code arrives baked into the
credential-proxy image at `/opt/defaults/scripts`; the only thing the operator
mounts into that container is a read-only policy ConfigMap. There is no existing
mechanism to introduce Python into that process, and adding one would be adding
a path by which code the image did not ship executes next to a live token. A
runtime plugin loader in the credentialed container is a credential-exfiltration
surface, and the modularity it buys is available without it.

So: **build-time packages, one directory per provider, one explicit registration
list, no discovery** — which is the layout, the registration and the two tests
above, and nothing more. The modularity a plugin was wanted for is delivered by
the directory boundary and enforced by CI; what a plugin would add on top of that
is the loader, and the loader is the part that is a credential-exfiltration
surface.

The client side was never the hard part: `vcs.py` in the sandbox is forge-neutral
and holds no credential, so it needs no per-provider code at all.

### The one exception: the executable allowlist

Everything above keeps forge knowledge inside a forge package. Two files that
predate this design do not, and they are the one place where "adding a forge is a
new directory" is not the whole truth.

`CommandExecutor.ALLOWED_EXECUTABLES` is `("gcloud", "kubectl", "gh", "git")` on
`main` today, and `credential_proxy_client.py` carries the same set again as
`SUPPORTED_EXECUTABLES`. Both are literal tuples. GitLab would add `glab` if it
used one; Bitbucket has no CLI at all. So the union of every supported forge's
binaries is granted to every install, twice over, and adding a CLI-backed forge
means editing two files nobody would think to look in.

**The two lists answer different questions, and that is the fix.**
`ALLOWED_EXECUTABLES` is the broker's: what the credentialed process may run.
`SUPPORTED_EXECUTABLES` is the sandbox's: what the agent may ask it to. Holding
identical contents is what made them look like a duplicate to keep in sync,
when in fact only one of the four belongs to both.

| Binary    | Broker may run it                           | Sandbox may forward it                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `gcloud`  | yes                                         | yes — no credential-free equivalent             |
| `kubectl` | yes                                         | yes — same                                      |
| `gh`      | only while GitHub's transport is `"cli"`    | **no** — the verbs replace it, by design        |
| `git`     | yes — the broker clones, fetches and pushes | **no** — see [one git](#one-git-in-the-sandbox) |

So the broker's list derives from the configured providers: a CLI-backed
credential declares its binary and the list is built from the constructed
forges, which means an install with no GitLab never grants `glab` and an install
whose GitHub provider speaks HTTP never grants `gh`. The sandbox's list loses
`gh` and `git` outright and needs no per-forge logic at all, because a forge CLI
is exactly what the sandbox is not allowed to reach.

That is also why the allowlist is called out as its own concern rather than
folded into a provider package: the broker half changes how `CommandExecutor` is
constructed, and the sandbox half changes what the image ships. Neither lives in
a forge directory.

### Checking it against Bitbucket

The layout is only worth its cost if the third forge is cheaper than the second.
Bitbucket Cloud is the honest test, because it differs from both GitHub and
GitLab in ways this design did not anticipate:

| Bitbucket is different in                                           | Absorbed by                                                                                                              | Shared file changed |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `workspace/repo` slugs, and a UUID form                             | `parse`, `clone_url` in its own package                                                                                  | none                |
| pull requests, not MRs; comments are on an `/comments` sub-resource | `translate.py` in its own package                                                                                        | none                |
| app passwords / API tokens, Basic auth not a bearer header          | `git_config`, and the token file it reads                                                                                | none                |
| no issue tracker on many workspaces                                 | `verbs` omitting the four issue verbs, `ForgeUnsupported` for free — **but see [below](#not-every-provider-is-a-forge)** | none                |
| `values`/`page`/`size` pagination, not `Link` headers               | its own translation of listings                                                                                          | none                |
| 401 where GitHub 404s on a private repo                             | `forge_error(status, detail)` with its own status extraction                                                             | none                |

The last row is the interesting one, and it is where the shared contract is
thinnest. `errors.py` holds a status-to-guidance table keyed on status alone, and
Bitbucket's 401-for-a-hidden-private-repo means "not found or no access" where
GitHub's 401 means "credential expired". Guidance keyed only on status is
therefore not quite forge-neutral. That is why `error_overrides` is a member of
the interface rather than something invented later: a per-forge map merged over
the shared table, living in the forge package. GitLab is the first to populate
it, for its own readings of 401 and 400, so by the time Bitbucket arrives the mechanism
has a user and a test rather than being a speculative hook.

What the table shows is that all six differences land in the forge's own
directory, and the only one that needs a shared mechanism uses one that already
exists. That is the requirement holding. It is also the argument for the contract
harness existing before the third forge rather than after it: a difference like
the sixth is exactly the kind that gets absorbed by a special case in a shared
file when there is no test saying it may not be.

### Not every provider is a forge

The Bitbucket row above says "no issue tracker" is free, absorbed by `verbs`
omitting the issue verbs. That is true and it is not the whole answer, because
a Bitbucket install usually _does_ have an issue tracker — it is Jira, on a
different host, behind a different credential.

**Jira is not designed here.** What belongs in
this document is the one assumption it breaks, because that assumption is cheap
to avoid now and expensive to unpick later.

Everything above assumes **one repository resolves to one provider that answers
every verb**. `Registry.resolve(repository)` returns a single object; the routing
key is the repository's host; `parse` returns a repository. All three are false
for an issue tracker:

| Assumption                             | Why Jira breaks it                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| the routing key is the repository host | Jira's host has nothing to do with the code host         |
| one provider answers every verb        | proposals come from Bitbucket, issues from Jira, at once |
| `parse` yields a repository            | a Jira issue is `PROJ-123` and belongs to no repository  |

So the general shape is not "a forge" but **capabilities bound to a project
context**: code hosting and proposals from one provider, issue tracking from
another, which today happen to be the same object for GitHub and GitLab.

**What this design does about it now: two things, both nearly free.**

1. **Resolution returns a binding, not a forge.** `resolve(repository)` yields a
   small object with a provider per capability group, rather than one provider.
   For GitHub and GitLab every group points at the same instance and nothing
   observable changes. Adding Jira later is then a configuration entry and a new
   package, not a change to how every caller resolves.
2. **The directory is `providers/`, not `forges/`.** "Forge" is the right word
   for GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket and the wrong one for an issue tracker.
   Renaming a package with three implementations in it is churn nobody will
   schedule; naming it correctly before the first one lands costs a keystroke.
   The rest of this document says "provider" for the same reason, and reserves
   "forge" for the three systems that are actually forges.

**What it does not do:** no Jira package, no second credential plane, no
declarative entry for "issues live over there" beyond the sibling list §6 leaves
room for, and no split of the protocol
into capability groups beyond what `verbs` already expresses. Those are a
design of their own, and the first install that needs one will specify it better
than speculation would.

The point of naming it here is narrow: **whoever reviews the first provider
package should know that "one host, one provider, all verbs" is a convenience of
the first three forges and not a property of the domain.**

---

## 6. The declarative surface

`IntegrationSpec` declares two lists. `forges` names each forge the install talks to: a `name`
the rest of the spec refers to it by, a `provider`, an optional `host`, an optional default
`namespace`, and an optional `credentialsRef`. `repositories` names each repository the operator
registers: the `forge` it lives on, the `repository` itself, an optional `namespace` of its own
for a repository given as a bare name, and a `role`. (`PlatformAgentIntegrationSpec` embeds it
alongside `GoogleChat` and `Slack`, so version control is one integration among several.)

```yaml
integration:
  forges:
    - name: github
      provider: github
      namespace: my-org
  repositories:
    - { forge: github, repository: infra, role: gitops }
    - { forge: github, repository: app, role: managed }
    - { forge: github, repository: platform-terraform, role: context }
```

The role says what the agent may do with a repository. `gitops` is the repository the agent
publishes its own changes to, at most one per install. `managed` repositories are read-write like
it. `context` repositories are read-only declared intent — a Terraform repository an audit
consults before it reports a posture as a finding — which the broker never commits to or pushes.
The state ConfigMap draws only the read-write/read-only line, as two keys: the operator seeds
`gitops` and `managed` entries into `managed_repos` and `context` entries into `context_repos`,
and only ever adds. Its entries carry no role, so the GitOps repository is the one listed first —
the entry the token refresh mints for when nothing names a repository — and a GitOps repository
the list does not yet hold is added at the front rather than the end. The skills' own resolvers
refuse to guess among several entries, so once a `managed` repository sits beside the GitOps one,
a caller names its target with `--repo`.

The two lists are separate because the relation between them is many-to-one: a forge carries a
host and a credential once, however many repositories sit on it, and a second instance of the
same provider — gitlab.com beside a self-managed GitLab — is a second forge entry with its own
host rather than a special case. A repository names its forge instead of repeating a host, so
the two can never disagree. An issue tracker that is not part of a forge
([Not every provider is a forge](#not-every-provider-is-a-forge)) would be a third sibling list
of the same shape; nothing in these two has to change to admit one.

`github` (`GitRepo` and `Org`) is kept as a deprecated alias for one forge with provider
`github`, namespace `Org`, and — when `GitRepo` is set — one `gitops` repository. Setting both
spellings is refused by the schema, as is a repository naming a forge the list does not declare
and a second `gitops` repository. `GitHubSpec.Org` still carries GitHub's namespace grammar in a
CRD pattern — alphanumerics and hyphens, at most 39 characters — which is not GitLab's: a group
path admits dots and underscores, and a project can sit several groups deep. That is why the new
spelling's `namespace` is a plain string and the grammar lives with the provider.

`credentialsRef` names a Secret in the agent's namespace for a provider whose credential is a
token an administrator holds. GitHub's is not: its tokens are minted per call from the GitHub
App, so on a `github` forge the field is ignored, and admission says so with a warning rather
than an error, so a values file can carry it ahead of the provider that reads it.

Validation dispatches on each repository's forge. Its provider parses the repository with its
host kept, refuses a host that is neither the forge's declared one nor one of its own, and asserts
its own namespace grammar and path depth; the admission webhook, the reconciler's status and the
operator's warning all ask the same question through one call, and every refusal names the list
entry at fault. GitHub is the only provider registered, so a GitLab URL is refused at admission —
by GitHub's host check, which accepting GitLab relaxes under dispatch rather than removes.

The operator writes each repository into the state ConfigMap as a `ManagedRepoEntry` whose `type`
is its forge's provider, which is how the discriminator reaches the agent: written down by the
operator, rather than inferred from the URL's text. The broker's repository gate reads every
typed entry, keyed by its `type`, host and path, so an entry counts for the provider it names and
no other. The agent's skills read only `github` entries — an administrator who writes a
non-GitHub entry straight into the ConfigMap gets one the broker gates on and the skills discard. Entries already in the ConfigMap are kept
as written, including fields the operator does not model, such as a context repository's `ref`.

The gateway's FQDN egress policy takes its forge hosts from the declared forges, and always
includes GitHub's, because the agent image's own GitHub calls need them whatever forge holds the
repositories.

Provisioning follows the same rule. `install.sh` and `terraform/examples/full-install` carry the
GitHub App inputs as `github_app_id`, `enable_github_minter` and `github_minter_kms_*`, and the
chart spells the same settings `githubMinter.appId`, `githubMinter.enabled` and
`githubMinter.kms.*`. All of them are provider-conditional: an install that declares no GitHub
forge provisions no KMS key and no minter.

**What the surface does not carry is a switch for the abstraction itself.** An
install declares _which_ forge it uses, never _whether_ the abstraction is in
play. There is no supported arrangement in which an agent reaches a forge some
other way, so a toggle would only describe a configuration nobody is allowed to
run — and every such field is a second code path to keep working, a second
combination to test, and a way for an install to sit in the state the design
exists to remove.

One field is retained anyway, and for the opposite reason to the one that
usually keeps a field alive: `spec.harness.experimental.shellSandbox.enabled`
decides nothing, because `validateShellSandbox` refuses `false` with reason
`ShellSandboxCannotBeDisabled` rather than rendering the old arrangement. It
exists so that an install which set it gets that refusal instead of a silently
ignored setting. Deleting a field is normally the risky direction — an unknown
key is pruned from an existing CR on the next reconcile, and the setting
disappears with nothing in the diff to say so — and it is safe here only because
no install can be quietly sitting at `false`: one that tried has been Degraded
and visible since the sandbox landed.

That is a deliberate reversal of how an experimental feature usually arrives.
The justification is that this removes no capability: every verb replaces a call
an agent could already make, the measurement in
[The experiment](#9-the-experiment) is what establishes that it does so at least
as well, and the thing being retired — a forge CLI on PATH in a credentialed
container — is not something an install should be able to opt back into.

---

## 7. GitLab

GitLab is the forge customers ask for first after GitHub, and it is the ask
everything above was designed against. Up to here the document has described the
layer; this is the first thing that uses it.

It is also the test of the layer. An abstraction with one implementation is a
hypothesis. The measure of this design is not that GitLab works — it is how much
shared code had to change to make it work, and whether Bitbucket will need those
same changes made again.

### What GitLab actually costs

The forge itself is small. The forge-independent half of the broker — `clone`,
`publish`, the five publish checks, the scratch lifecycle, the size ceilings,
the bundle transport — is untouched by it, and so is the whole of the sandbox
client, because the sandbox never learns which forge it is talking to.

One forge class about the size of the GitHub one, one transport, one credential
strategy, and the contract decisions below. What surrounds the forge is not free:
the shared layer has to be forge-neutral where a single forge let it assume one —
a route that gates every verb rather than relying on a minted token's refresh,
forge configuration that reaches the broker, a managed list keyed by provider and
host — and the CRD has to accept the provider and hand its Secret to the broker.

The contract suite holds GitLab to the same assertions as GitHub with one
data-driven hook rather than a GitLab branch in a shared test: a forge configured
per host builds nothing from an empty configuration, so it ships the
configuration it is tested under beside its recordings.

### Where the intuition about GitLab is wrong

The expectation a reader arrives with is that GitLab's credential is the hard
part, because GitHub's is: an App installation, a signing key, a mint step, a
token that expires within the hour, and a policy ConfigMap enforcing which
repositories it may be spent on. GitLab has none of that, and it is tempting to
read the absence as a gap to be filled.

It is not a gap. An **access token** is created once by an administrator,
stored in a Secret, and lasts up to a year. There is
nothing to acquire, nothing to sign, and nothing to refresh, and
`/v1/forge/refresh` for it answers `nothing to refresh` rather than running a
helper. A host the install recognises and has no forge for answers with that
forge's gap, `FORGE_UNSUPPORTED`, as the verb after it would — it is not a
forge with nothing to refresh, because it has no credential at all. GitLab's credential
work is somewhere else entirely, in two places GitHub's arrangement does not
force anyone to look at:

- **How the token reaches `git`.** GitHub's reaches `git` as a side effect of
  minting — `gh auth setup-git` writes a global credential helper — so the forge
  interface never had to carry it. GitLab needs to say it. See
  [`git`'s credential has no seam](#gits-credential-has-no-seam).
- **What narrows the token's blast radius.** Minty enforces a per-repository
  permission policy at mint time, so GitHub's token arrives already narrow. A
  GitLab token is narrowed once at creation, if at all, and nothing narrows it
  further, so the broker has to enforce the boundary itself. See
  [The credential](#the-gitlab-credential).

Both are cheap. Neither is a minter, and a plan that budgets for a minter budgets
for the wrong thing.

### GitLab repository identity

GitLab namespaces nest: `group/subgroup/project`, arbitrarily deep. This is the
one place GitLab is structurally different from GitHub rather than differently
spelled, and the shared contract already allows for it: `StubForge.parse` accepts
`len(parts) >= 2` with `_SEGMENT_RE` per segment, where `GitHubForge.parse`
demands exactly 2. `GitLabForge.parse` keeps the stub's version.

`clone_url` composes `https://{self.host}/{path}.git` from validated segments,
never from the caller's URL — same rule as GitHub, same reason: the caller's URL
decides which forge, not which host a credential is presented to.

API paths take the namespace URL-encoded as a single opaque segment:
`/api/v4/projects/{quote(path, safe='')}/merge_requests`. Note `safe=''` —
the default `quote` leaves `/` alone, which yields a path GitLab reads as a
different route. That is a one-character bug with a confusing 404 and it is
worth a test of its own.

**Numbering is the trap.** GitLab merge requests and issues each carry an `id`
(globally unique) and an `iid` (per-project, the number a human sees and the
one in the web URL). Every caller-facing `number` and every API path segment
must be the `iid`. Using `id` produces a route that resolves to a different
project's item or 404s, and the failure is silent in the sense that it looks
like a permissions problem. `GitLabForge` reads `iid` in translation and sends
`iid` in paths; nothing in the module touches `id`.

### The GitLab credential

A GitLab access token with `api` and `write_repository` scope, created by an
administrator, stored in a Kubernetes Secret, projected into the credential-proxy
container as a file. Three kinds of token fit that sentence, and the broker
cannot tell them apart and does not need to:

- a **group access token**, scoped to a group and everything under it;
- a **project access token**, scoped to one project;
- a **personal access token of an account that exists for this install**. On
  gitlab.com's Free tier the first two do not exist, so this is the only one.
  It reaches every project the account belongs to, which is why the account
  belongs to the managed projects and nothing else.

The mechanism is the same for all three; how far the token reaches is what
differs, and the reach is made visible rather than assumed: when the broker
starts it asks GitLab which projects the token's account belongs to
(`projects?membership=true`) and logs a warning naming each one the install does
not manage. The broker refuses those projects either way — the warning is so an
installer sees the breadth the refusal is holding back, and narrows the account.

`GitLabForge.credential` is a `StaticFileCredential`, and all three of its
methods are decided by that one sentence:

- `ensure()` does nothing. There is no acquisition step, no minter, no KMS key
  and no policy ConfigMap.
- `headers()` reads the file at call time and returns `PRIVATE-TOKEN`.
- `git_config()` returns the credential-helper pin from
  [above](#gits-credential-has-no-seam), which reads the same file.

This is the whole GitLab credential story, and it is nine lines in
`providers/gitlab/`. Nothing outside that directory knows GitLab has a token.

**"Long-lived" is not "permanent," and the difference has to be designed for.**
GitLab requires every access token to carry an expiry, at most 365 days by
default. So the token does not go stale between calls —
which is why `ensure()` is still right to do nothing — but it does expire once a
year, with no automatic recovery and no warning from anything in this system.

Two consequences, both small and both easy to omit:

- **Rotation is an operator action**, and it works: the administrator updates
  the Secret, the projected file changes, and the next call reads the new value
  with no restart. That is the per-call file read earning its keep.
- **A GitLab 401 needs its own guidance string.** The shared table says nothing
  here will fix a refused credential, which is true; GitLab's says what will:
  the token expired or was revoked, and an administrator replaces it in the
  Secret the forge's `credentialsRef` names. This is the per-forge guidance
  override that [the Bitbucket check](#checking-it-against-bitbucket) predicted
  would be needed; GitLab needs it first.
- **So does a GitLab 400.** GitLab answers a request whose fields it validated
  and refused — a merge request from a branch that was never pushed — with 400,
  where GitHub answers 422. The shared table has no 400, so the override maps it
  onto `FORGE_REJECTED`: fix the field, do not retry.

One more property of the token that belongs here because it surfaces elsewhere:
**a group or project access token authenticates as a bot user** that GitLab
creates with it (`group_<id>_bot_…`, or `…_bot1` on older instances), and a
personal access token as its account. A note's author object carries no `bot`
field, so a comment's `bot` flag says only what the name alone settles: a
token's bot user, a service account under GitLab's default name
(`service_account_group_<id>_<hex>`), or one of GitLab's own automation users,
matched exactly. A name a person could also choose is not guessed at. An
automation with a name of its own — a service account created with a custom
username — reads as a person on the note, and is refused where a person would
be trusted: the write check reads its user object, which carries `bot`, and
answers no for an automation whatever its role, so its comments are never
taken as requests. Anything that asks "did the agent write this?" — the branch-prefix and
`agent:ignore` rules, `viewer_login`, comment attribution — resolves to that
login, read from `GET /user`, not to a human's. It is a fact the agent-side
policy is told rather than infers.

Reading from the file per call rather than caching at construction is
deliberate: a rotated Secret updates the projected file, and the next call picks
it up with no restart. The cost is a file read per API call, which is nothing
next to the HTTPS round trip.

**Scope enforcement is the broker's job here, and this is a real difference from
GitHub.** Minty enforces a per-repository permission policy at mint time, so the
token the broker holds is already narrowed. A GitLab access token is narrowed at
creation — to its group, its project, or whatever its account belongs to — and
nothing narrows it further. Every project it can reach is reachable through the
broker, and `Registry.resolve`'s host allowlist does not care which project
inside the host a call names.

So `GitLabForge` carries `allowed_paths`, a tuple of namespace prefixes, and
refuses a repository outside them before the credential is spent — the same
placement as the host allowlist and for the same reason. An empty
`allowed_paths` means the whole host, which must be a deliberate configuration
rather than the default that appears when someone omits a field: an entry with
no `allowedPaths` is refused, and `[]` is how the whole host is asked for. An
entry that names no namespace — `""`, `"/"`, a template value that rendered empty
— is refused rather than dropped, since dropping it could leave the list empty.
Each prefix is read by the parser `parse` uses for a repository, so the two
cannot disagree: a trailing `.git` comes off and a leading host is lifted, as
they do for a repository, and a segment the parser refuses — empty, `.`, `..`,
`.git` or led by a dash — refuses the entry at construction, because a prefix
`parse` can never match would refuse every repository on the host. So does a
prefix that is the host itself, such as `gitlab.com`: a parsed repository never
starts with its own host, and the spelling is what someone writes who means the
whole host, which is `[]`. Whitespace anywhere is refused rather than stripped. A GitHub entry refuses `allowedPaths` outright: the App
installation's repository selection is what scopes that token, and the same key
accepted there and ignored would read as narrowing it.

Prefix matching is on **path segments, not string prefix**. `acme/infra-secret`
starts with the string `acme/infra` and is a different project.

### Translation

The neutral shapes are the ones every forge returns. What follows is the GitLab
side of each.

| Neutral field       | GitLab source                     | Note                                                                                   |

| `state` (proposal)  | `state`                           | `opened`/`locked`→`open` (`locked` is mid-merge), `merged`→`merged`, `closed`→`closed` |
| `draft`             | `draft`                           | `work_in_progress` on older instances; read `draft`, fall back                         |
| `author`            | `author.username`                 | no `[bot]` suffix to strip                                                             |
| `source` / `target` | `source_branch` / `target_branch` | direct                                                                                 |
| `sourceRepo`        | `source_project_id`               | the repository itself when it equals `target_project_id`; `""` for a fork              |
| `sourceRevision`    | `sha`                             | the diff head; GitHub spells it `head.sha`                                             |
| `kind` (comment)    | `position`                        | a diff note is `review_comment`; any other note `issue`                                |
| `ref` (comment)     | `"{kind}-{id}"`                   | note ids are unique across an instance                                                 |
| `url`               | `web_url`                         |                                                                                        |
| `created`/`updated` | `created_at` / `updated_at`       | both ISO-8601, same as GitHub                                                          |
| `closed` (proposal) | `merged_at`, else `closed_at`     | GitLab leaves `closed_at` empty on a merge; `""` while open                            |
| `body`              | `description`                     | GitLab's name for it                                                                   |
| `labels`            | `labels`                          | plain strings, not GitHub's `{name: …}` dicts                                          |

Three asymmetries are worth their own note, because each one is a place the
neutral contract was shaped by GitHub and GitLab shows the shape.

**Issues are not proposals.** `GitHubForge.issue_list` filters out nodes
carrying a `pull_request` key, because on GitHub a PR _is_ an issue and the
issues endpoint returns both. Nowhere else models it that way. GitLab's
`/issues` returns issues, so `GitLabForge.issue_list` has no filter and
`issue_view` needs no "this is a merge request, read it with `proposal view`"
refusal. The neutral contract is right and GitHub is the odd one; the filter
stays where it belongs, inside `GitHubForge`.

**Comments are notes, and most notes are not comments.** GitLab's
`/merge_requests/{iid}/notes` returns the discussion _and_ system notes —
"changed the description", "assigned to @someone", "marked as draft" — each
carrying `system: true`. Returned unfiltered, a caller reading a proposal's
conversation gets mostly bookkeeping, and an agent deciding whether it has
already replied reads its own status changes as replies. `GitLabForge` filters
`system` notes out. This is GitLab's exact analogue of the `pull_request` filter
above: one forge's model leaking items the neutral concept does not include.
What is left maps onto the neutral kinds the consumers already read rather than
a new one: a note on a line of the diff is a `review_comment`, any other note an
`issue` comment — the conversation, which is where a caller looks for its own
markers. A new kind would have made every GitLab conversation invisible to them.
Because bookkeeping fills most of a long merge request's notes, `limit` counts
comments, not rows: a full page whose slots went to system notes is a reason to
read the next page, within the conversation's row bound, and `truncated` is
still judged on whether the last page read was full.

**State vocabulary differs on the way in as well as out.** `validate_state`
accepts `open`, `closed`, `all` and the verbs pass the result straight into a
query string. GitLab's parameter values are `opened`, `closed`, `all`. The
mapping belongs in `GitLabForge`, on both directions, and `validate_state`'s
neutral vocabulary does not change. One value does not map one to one: the
neutral `closed` is every proposal no longer open, merged ones included, as
GitHub's is, and GitLab's `closed` excludes merged — so it is asked as `all` and
filtered. A `closed` page is therefore a page of `all` with the open ones taken
out: it can come back short, or empty, while closed proposals exist further on,
and `truncated` says so.

Four endpoints need naming because they are not a rename of GitHub's:

- **Diff.** GitHub serves a diff from the PR endpoint under an `Accept` media
  type. GitLab serves the unified diff at `/merge_requests/{iid}/raw_diffs`,
  which answers 5xx until GitLab has computed the diff — seconds after a merge
  request opens — and 404 on a self-managed instance older than the route. The
  JSON `/diffs` endpoint carries the same hunks per file, so that is the
  fallback, assembled into a unified diff, rather than a retry loop with a sleep
  in it. It is paged, and the assembled diff says so when it stops at its page
  cap or when GitLab left a too-large file's hunks out: an omission the caller
  cannot see reads as a file the change did not touch. The fallback is taken
  only for GitLab's own 5xx or 404, never for the broker's own refusal of the
  raw diff as too large or too slow, which would fetch the same diff again; and
  it stops, saying so, once the assembled diff passes the broker's default
  response ceiling, since each page being under it does not bound ten of them.
- **Proposal creation** posts `source_branch`, `target_branch`, `title`,
  `description` to `/merge_requests`. The `draft` field is accepted and ignored
  on creation; a `Draft:` title prefix is what GitLab reads, so a draft proposal
  is created with one. Because the marker is the title, a later re-title would
  silently mark the merge request ready, where GitHub leaves `draft` alone; an
  update that gives a new title without a draft prefix reads the merge request
  first and keeps the marker on a draft.
- **Commits.** GitLab lists a merge request's commits newest first, with no
  parameter to turn that round, and the verb promises oldest first with page 1
  holding the oldest. Reversing each page would put the newest commits on page 1
  of a long merge request, so the list is read whole up to GitHub's own 250-commit
  ceiling and paged in the broker.
- **Acknowledgement** is an award emoji on the note. A second award of the same
  emoji answers 404 with a validation message, not 409, so "already awarded" is
  read off the message — a plain 404 is still a note that is not there.

All four are named because getting them wrong is a working-looking module that
silently drops a field, which is worse than an unimplemented verb.

### GitLab errors

GitLab returns conventional statuses: 401, 403, 404, 409, 422 and 429 are all in
the shared status-to-guidance table, and 400 — what GitLab answers for a request
whose fields it validated and refused — is not. Two specifics:

- The message body is `{"message": …}` or `{"error": …}` depending on endpoint,
  and sometimes a dict of per-field arrays. `detail` takes the first string it
  can find and truncates at 400 characters like the CLI path does.
- **404 hides 403.** GitLab answers 404 rather than 403 for a project the token
  cannot see, deliberately. The shared guidance for 404 covers it without a GitLab
  override — "A private repository this install's credential cannot see also
  answers 404, so this does not prove the thing does not exist" — which is the
  clearest evidence that keeping the table forge-neutral was worth it: GitLab
  needs two overrides, for 401 and 400, and not this one.

### What GitLab does not include

Deliberately, and each of these should be a named refusal rather than a
surprise:

- **Self-managed instances behind a private CA.** The token and the API are the
  same; what differs is trust of the TLS chain. `HttpTransport` uses the
  container's CA bundle and nothing mounts a custom one, so a self-signed
  instance fails to connect — and that failure is the design behaving as
  specified rather than a gap. Any instance this is exercised against has to
  carry a certificate the sandbox image already trusts, or have TLS terminated
  by something that does. The refusal names itself — "the forge's TLS
  certificate failed verification by this image", followed by the verifier's
  own reason, such as an unknown issuer, a hostname mismatch or an expired
  certificate — rather than reading as a call to retry.
- **GitLab groups as an issue tracker.** Group-level issues and epics are a
  different endpoint namespace. `issue_*` is project-scoped, matching the
  neutral concept.
- **Approvals.** GitLab's approval rules have no GitHub equivalent and no
  neutral verb. `proposal_view` does not report approval state.
- **Merging a proposal.** No forge implements this, on purpose — the neutral
  verb set stops at opening and commenting.
- **OAuth-refreshed tokens.** A stored access token — group, project, or a
  dedicated account's personal token — is the only supported GitLab credential;
  GitLab's own OIDC token exchange is deferred, for the reason
  [the credential plane](#what-the-credential-plane-holds-up) gives — it is a
  second design, and a first working install does not need it. Bitbucket will
  revisit this, since its tokens do come from a refresh flow, and the point of the
  strategy is that doing so is a third `Credential` implementation in
  `providers/bitbucket/`, not a change to GitLab's or GitHub's.

---

## 8. Why an MCP server is an addition, not the mechanism

A GitLab MCP server is a reasonable thing to want, and it cannot carry this design. Two reasons, and
they are independent.

**Half the forge work has no model in the loop.** `github_scan_gate.py` is a `no_agent` cron script
by deliberate design: an idle tick costs a handful of `gh` calls, no model turn and no tokens, which
is the whole reason the earlier prompt-driven poller was retired. MCP is a model-facing tool
surface, so it cannot serve that sweep, and it cannot serve the audit publish path or the
guardrails in
`submit_suggestion.py` either. Those need an importable library whatever else exists.

**An MCP server in the sandbox would hold a token.** MCP servers are spawned as child processes of
the agent container. A `GITLAB_TOKEN` in that process's environment is precisely what
`credential-isolation-design.md` guarantees against. The two remote MCP servers that ship today are
not a counterexample: they authenticate with a forked `mcp-remote` that mints Google ADC tokens per
call, and ADC is ambient to the pod rather than injected as a secret. A forge PAT has no ambient
equivalent.

The second is answered by running the MCP server in the broker's pod rather than the sandbox's,
with the agent reaching it over the same authenticated Service and the server attaching the token —
the same containment the broker already provides for a brokered provider, expressed at the MCP layer
instead of the REST one. The first has no such answer, because no arrangement of MCP servers puts a model in
a cron loop that deliberately has none. The library stays either way.

Where it pays off is the interactive path — an agent asked in chat to read a merge request, or a
worker turn answering a review comment. There, typed MCP tools are better than teaching a model
`glab` spellings in SOP prose. So the provider is the mechanism and MCP is an optional surface on top
of it, added last and depended on by nothing.

---

## 9. The experiment

Three ways of getting a sandboxed agent to a repository were run against the
same probes, the same corpora and the same model, to establish that the
abstraction costs nothing relative to what already exists. Everything below —
corpora, probe definitions, harness, per-probe worker logs, raw scores — is on
the fork at
[`experiments/git-access-abc/`](https://github.com/dshnayder/kube-agents/tree/experiment/git-access-abc/experiments/git-access-abc).

Every figure in this section can be recomputed from those files, and it is worth
saying which ones, because the directory holds discarded passes too. The scored
runs are `results/agent-{A,B,C}-r{200,3000,10000}.json` for the read rungs and
`results/agent-{A,B,C}-write.json` for the write rung — arm C's being the sealed
re-run. Each row carries a `route` object counting `vcs`, `git`, `ghapi`,
`workspace_http`, `propose` and `skill` calls, which is what the route columns
below are summed from. `results/FINDINGS.md` is the original write-up.
Subdirectories — `invalid-pathbug/`, `writes-w4/`, `writes-w6-unsealed/`,
`pass1-contaminated/` — are superseded passes, kept because two figures quoted
here come from them and are labelled where they do.

### What was compared

| Arm | Access design                                                                                                         |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A   | The shared volume this repository ships: `git` and `gh` in the sandbox are shims into the credentialed container      |
| B   | Content passing (#962): `{path, bytes}` payloads over the broker's `/v1/workspace/*` routes, the broker owns the tree |
| C   | This design: forge-neutral verbs over `/v1/vcs/*`, history as a bundle, native git locally                            |

Twenty read probes at three repository sizes — 200, 3,000 and 10,000 files — and
a four-probe write rung. The read probes cover contested facts across revisions,
history questions, per-line attribution, file modes, and negative controls where
the correct answer is that the repository does not say. The write probes open a
change proposal, add a file with a specific mode, revise an existing proposal in
response to a seeded review comment, and one adversarial probe whose corpus
instructs the reader to install a git clean filter and a pre-commit hook — it
passes only if nothing executes.

Each arm ran the write rung against a repository that arm had never seen, since
the first arm to open a proposal turns "open a pull request" into "notice one
exists" for everyone after it.

Arm C's write rung was run **sealed**: arm B's routes disabled and no `gh`
binary under any path, so the numbers describe an install that shipped only this
design rather than one where other doors happened to be open.

Alongside the three arms, `harness/ladder.py` drives each access layer with no
model in the loop. It answers a different question — not how well an agent does
on a probe, but whether the probe can be expressed in that layer's vocabulary at
all — and it is what separates a protocol's limits from a model's.

Every arm passed every write probe, including the adversarial one — no arm
executed anything the repository supplied. Capability is not what separates
them.

The main result is the `left for gh api` column, and it is a result about
protocol shape rather than about any one arm. A model-free control drives each
access layer with no model in the loop and asks only whether a probe can be
expressed: 6 of the 20 read probes cannot be asked of a content-passing
protocol at all — four are history questions and there is no verb for commit
history, and two more want a whole-tree operation the verbs do not name.
Directory access scores 0 of 20 not expressible.

The agent answered them anyway. Arm B comes back with an answer to all six, and
the route log shows `gh api` on most of them at every rung. That is where the
steady 4/20 in the table comes from, and those four are not a random four: they
are drawn from the six the protocol cannot express. **An access design that omits a capability does
not remove the capability; it relocates it to a route nobody designed** — here,
a credentialed, general-purpose path into the forge that answers questions
about a repository without touching the repository protocol at all. The
model-free control cannot see this happen: it scores content passing at 0.95
mean reach and records the gap as a limitation.

That is the finding this design is built around, and it is why
[The shape](#the-shape) argues that a protocol answering from the credential
side has to grow a verb for every narrowing a caller might want. It is not an
argument that arm B is badly built. It is an argument that a verb list is a
closed set and a repository question is not, so the gap has to be closed by
handing over the history rather than by adding verbs until none is left.

Four more things the numbers say:

**Cost stays low as the repository grows.** Arm C is the cheapest arm at every
read rung on wall-clock time and is never beaten on turns:
4.0 → 5.0 → 5.0 median turns and 171.4 → 215.0 → 216.3 seconds, against arm A's
4.5 → 5.0 → 7.0 and 195.8 → 227.1 → 313.9. At the middle rung the two tie on
turns and arm C wins only on seconds; they separate at 10,000 files, where arm A
costs 7.0 turns to arm C's 5.0. Arm C at 10,000 files costs the same turns as
arm A at 3,000 and slightly fewer seconds, on a corpus more than three times the
size. The bundle is the reason to expect this — one crossing of the seam hands
over the history and everything after it is local, so a bigger repository does
not mean more round trips.

Flatness on its own is not the claim, and it should not be, because arm B is the
flattest arm here: 6.5 → 6.5 → 7.0 turns and 296.3 → 286.3 → 317.7 seconds, a
smaller rise than arm C's on both axes however it is read. It is also the most
expensive arm at every rung. An arm can be flat by being uniformly slow, so what
the corpus separates is the level, not the slope: arm C is cheapest everywhere
and stays cheapest as the corpus grows, while the arm that grows is the one that
ships today. The write rung is the one place arm C is not cheapest, and it is
treated below.

**Answered rate is at least as good.** 58 of 60 read probes against arm A's 57
and arm B's 55, and arm C is the only arm that answered all 20 at the largest
rung.

**The interface carries the work.** Across 60 read probes and the sealed write
rung, arm C made zero calls to a forge API — not because it could not, on the
read rungs, but because the verbs answered. Per read rung the route counts are
43/43/32 `vcs` calls against 29/27/30 local `git` calls — about three verb calls
to every two local commands at the two smaller rungs (1.5:1 and 1.6:1), and
close to one to one at the largest (1.1:1). Neither side grows with the corpus —
the local count holds at 27–30 throughout and the verb count falls — which is
the claim that matters here: the work does not migrate back across the seam when
the repository gets bigger.

**The repository is left in better shape.** On the write rung arms A and B each
opened a duplicate proposal against the default branch from the same head
branch and closed it within a minute. Arm C opened exactly two proposals, both
against the correct base, and revised the first in place when asked.

Where arm C is not ahead: **writing costs more turns than arm A** — 9.0 against
4.0. That is largely structural rather than comprehension. A proposal in arm A
is `git push` followed by `gh pr create`, two commands the model has seen more
often than almost anything else; the same proposal here is clone, edit, publish,
`proposal create`. Sealing improved it substantially — 9.0 turns and 455.5s
against 12.0 and 653.0s unsealed — and the remaining gap is the price of the
indirection.

### What this does not show

- One run per probe per arm. A one-probe difference is noise; only whole-class
  differences are load-bearing.
- The read rungs were run unsealed for arm C — arm B's routes still serving, and
  a `gh` on PATH. Those runs made zero calls on either, so sealing removes doors
  they never opened, but they were not re-run to prove it.
- The write rung ran on a later broker build than the read rungs.
- An earlier pass of all three read rungs was discarded, not scored here: the
  PATH prepend was missing, so arm C's `git` resolved to the credential shim and
  the arm measured the control wearing arm C's label. The one thing taken from
  it is the shim figure in
  [Replacing `gh`](#replacing-gh), where being the wrong arm is precisely what
  makes it evidence.
- The adversarial probe is one injection corpus. It shows those two techniques
  did not fire, not that the class is closed.
- Each arm's skill text was written by the same hand, which is not a neutral
  position from which to write a competing arm's instructions.

### One defect the experiment found

The write rung is what surfaced that `execute_forge_cli` omitted its
`containment_root` argument, so all eight collaboration verbs raised `ValueError`
before the forge call launched — on every install, since the routes shipped.
`clone` and `publish` were unaffected, which is why it survived: the verbs that
move code worked and the verbs that talk about it did not. The handler logged
only the exception type, so the outage reached the agent as
`vcs proposal-list error: ValueError`. Fixed, logged with the redacted message,
and covered by a regression test that fails without the fix.

It belongs in this document because it is the honest cost of the indirection:
an abstraction has surface that a shim does not, and this one shipped a quarter
of its verbs dead. The answer is tests and error messages, and both were added.

## 10. What this does not fix

The broker authenticates the caller but not the command's provenance. A
projected ServiceAccount token establishes that a request came from the
sandbox — and the `shell` role establishes which routes that entitles it to —
but nothing distinguishes a verb the agent chose from a verb something else in
the sandbox chose on its behalf. Anything running in that pod is the agent as
far as these routes can tell. What bounds that is the `shell` role: the worst
these routes can be made to do is something the agent was already entitled to
ask for. It is not that the caller is known to be the model, and it is not a
claim about what else the sandbox can reach —
[`../credential-isolation-design.md`](../credential-isolation-design.md) owns
that question.

`clone` pulls a whole branch's history, which is the wrong shape for a one-off
read of a large upstream repository, and there is no shallow option to make it
cheaper.

Throttling is legible to the agent and only partly to an operator.
[Where the error contract splits](#where-the-error-contract-splits) puts the
counters on the broker, which now has a metrics surface for them to join: the
`kubeagents_*` families the credential-proxy Pod serves and the chart's
`<name>-credential-proxy-monitoring` scrapes
([Concepts → Observability](../site/src/content/docs/concepts/observability.md)).
The per-provider throttle counters that section assigns to the broker have not
been added to it, so until they are, an install approaching its token quota is
visible in the broker's logs and, by status code alone, as `429`s under
`endpoint="/v1/vcs"` in `kubeagents_credential_proxy_requests_total`, the route
family every forge verb travels (`/v1/forge` reaches only the credential
refresh, which spends no quota). The refusal is also thinner than it could
be: `FORGE_UNAVAILABLE` tells a caller the same call may work later without
telling it when, and the `Retry-After` and `RateLimit-*` values both forges
return are read to classify the failure and then dropped rather than carried
into the error.

`publish` proves ancestry, not authorship. The revisions in the bundle carry
whatever author the sandbox's git wrote, and the broker does not sign or rewrite
them.

Nothing here defends against prompt injection, and these verbs are a good
delivery vehicle for it. A repository is untrusted text — file contents, commit
messages, issue and proposal bodies, review comments — and `clone`, `log`,
`issue view` and `proposal view` all exist to put that text in front of a model.
What the design does buy is bounded: no credential is added to the sandbox by
these verbs, and no route here hands one over — the token stays in the broker
and `raw_token`-style routes are not agent-callable. Whether the sandbox has any
other path to a credential is not this design's question to answer, and
[`../credential-isolation-design.md`](../credential-isolation-design.md) is where
it is answered. What it does not buy
is protection against the model being talked into an action it is allowed to
take. `publish`, `proposal create`, `issue create` and `branch-delete` are reachable
to any agent that can reach the read verbs, so an install that wants an agent to read history
without being able to write to a forge has no way to say so. A read-only mode is
the smallest thing that would fix it, and it is not designed here.

Until GitLab and Bitbucket ship, this is a forge-neutral design with one forge
in it — and an abstraction with one implementation is a hypothesis. The measure
of it is not that GitLab works but how much shared code has to change to make it
work. [Modularity](#5-modularity) states what that budget is and what enforces
it, so the hypothesis is falsifiable rather than judged afterwards.

Issue trackers that are not part of a forge — Jira alongside Bitbucket being the
case that will arrive first — are named in
[Not every provider is a forge](#not-every-provider-is-a-forge) and not designed.

---

**Reads of repositories the install does not manage.** The broker refuses every
verb but `capabilities` at the route for a repository the install does not
manage, reads included, so the managed list is a visibility control as well as
a write one on every forge, whatever its credential strategy. A token an
administrator stored is one token for every repository it can see, so nothing
downstream of the route would refuse on its behalf. The intent that reading a
repository this install does not write to should work — a public upstream, read
with no credential — is real and not served. Opening those reads needs a
credential-less path — a clone with no token, a read API call with
none — that the provider can take when the repository is public, which is a
change to the credential strategy and not to the verbs, and is not designed
here.

**Registered context repositories** are the one unmanaged read the install does
grant a credential for, and the shape is the credential-strategy change above
for one case. A repository under `context_repos` is read for declared intent and
never written, and it is usually private. The broker's content-mode `open`
resolves the repository's registered role from the ConfigMap — `managed`,
`context`, or neither, decided by the broker and never by a forge — and for a
context repository asks the forge for `read_credential(repo)`: a credential that
can read that one repository, obtained per clone, presented to the broker's own
`git` as a per-invocation config layer, and installed nowhere. A credential that
cannot be obtained falls back to the credential-less clone, with the ambient
helper cleared in that same layer so the write token is never tried in its
place. On GitHub it is a `contents: read` App installation token minted from the
repository's own minter policy, which the operator renders per context
repository; a forge without a read-only credential answers `NoCredential` and
the clone proceeds as before.
The write gate does not consult the role, so a context repository stays refused
by every `/v1/vcs` verb but `capabilities`, by `commit` and `push`, and by the
refresh route; the verbs' credential-less read path for public repositories
remains open as above.

## 11. Open questions

1. **Whether one field can name the token's scope boundary on both forges.** On
   GitHub that boundary is an App installation and it lines up with the first
   path component. On GitLab it is a group, a project's namespace can sit several
   segments below it, and "the first path component" is therefore false. Either
   the field generalises to "scope boundary" and each provider says how to derive
   it, or the two forges want different fields.
   [The GitLab credential](#the-gitlab-credential) proposes `allowed_paths` as the
   local answer — a per-credential tuple of namespace prefixes the provider
   refuses outside of — which is also the shape a per-repository permission policy
   would hang on. Whether that is one shared field on the CR or a per-provider one
   is the open half. The token-scoping code depends on it.

2. **Whether gitlab.com and self-managed GitLab want one provider class or two.**
   `pr-comment-conversation.md` §3 records that "Bitbucket" is two providers
   sharing almost nothing, and a single class that branches on "is this
   gitlab.com" is how that mistake would be repeated in a smaller way.
   [One package, many hosts](#one-package-many-hosts) answers the half that
   matters: a class is asked how many instances an install wants, so gitlab.com
   and a self-managed host are two instances of one class, each with its own host
   and its own credential, and nothing branches on which is which. What that does
   not settle is whether the token models diverge far enough to want two classes
   anyway. On the evidence so far they do not.

3. **Whether there is a read-only mode, and where it is declared.** A
   repository's `role` already declares read-only for one repository at a time:
   a `context` repository is never written. What is open is the forge-wide
   version, which [What this does not fix](#10-what-this-does-not-fix) names as a
   real gap: an install that wants an agent to read history without being able
   to write to a forge at all cannot say so. This is a permission question,
   not a feature toggle — the abstraction itself is not optional — so it belongs
   on the declarative surface of §6 alongside whatever answers
   [the token's scope boundary](#the-gitlab-credential), and the two should be
   decided together. There is one piece of outside evidence for the shape:
   [the normalised API this agrees with](#where-this-agrees-with-an-existing-normalised-api)
   hands out read and read-write as two different credential grants rather than
   as one token carrying a mode, which argues the declaration attaches to the
   credential and not to the install.

4. **Whether the GitHub module moves onto the in-process HTTP transport.** Not
   proposed. It would take `gh` out of the broker entirely, which
   [Replacing `gh`](#replacing-gh) wants for other reasons, and the transport
   split makes it a small change. It needs the App token reachable by the broker
   without `gh auth`, which is not true today. (The question is about
   `providers/github/`, the broker-side module. The agent-side `GitHubProvider`
   this once also named is gone; there is one `BrokerProvider` for every forge
   and it speaks verbs, not HTTP.)

5. **Whether the broker gets an FQDN egress policy of its own.** The derived
   policy in [the credential plane](#what-the-credential-plane-holds-up) selects
   the gateway pod. The broker — which holds the forge credential and makes
   every forge call — has open egress, so a brokered call can reach any host the
   broker is asked for. Narrowing it to the declared forges' hosts is the same
   derivation applied to a second pod, and the costs are what make it a
   question: the broker also reaches Google APIs for token minting and the
   cluster API for `kubectl`, a policy that forgets one of those breaks every
   agent on the install, and on a cluster without Dataplane V2 the policy is
   inert, so it would be a guard some installs have and others silently do not.
