# Documentation map

This file is the map of the Markdown documentation in the `kube-agents`
repository: what lives where, which files carry machine-generated regions and
from which sources, and which source file owns each identifier the docs state
as fact. It serves human contributors and AI agents alike — in particular, the
PR docs-drift review consults it to find which sources a code change should
have re-verified. What each document covers is the document's own business:
its title, its first paragraph, and the page that links it.

The documentation **rules** — the canonical-home table ("every fact has one
home"), the generated-regions rule, link-don't-summarise, verify identifiers
against source — are owned by [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) at the repository
root. This file is the **map**, not the rulebook; read `AGENTS.md` before
editing any doc.

## 1. Directory overview

Dot-directories at the repository root (`.agents/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`)
hold tooling — review skills, agent rules, PR templates, agent config — not
documentation; they are out of the map's scope, and the link check's
linked-from-somewhere rule (section 2) does not require them to be linked.
`.agents/rules/` is the one the canonical-home table in `AGENTS.md`
points at, so a rule's home is found through that table rather than through
this map. `.claude/skills` and `.claude/rules` are relative symlinks into
`.agents/`, not copies, so Claude Code reads the same files every other
harness does; [`tests/test_skill_discovery.py`](../tests/test_skill_discovery.py)
holds them to that.

The published documentation site is built from `docs/site/src/content/docs/`
and served from GitHub Pages at <https://gke-labs.github.io/kube-agents/>
(Astro `base: '/kube-agents'`).

## 2. Canonical homes, generated regions, and identifier sources

Which file owns which category of content is defined once, in the
canonical-home table in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — do not duplicate a fact
outside its home; link to it.

The artifacts below are **generated, not hand-written** — regions inside
hand-written documents (a region may be spliced into several pages), and the
line-number pins inside the governance cron prompts. `scripts/generate_docs.py`
(run via `make docs-generate`) rewrites everything between the markers;
`scripts/generate_sop_geography.py` (run first by the same target) rewrites the
pins' digits and nothing else. Everything outside the markers and the pins is
hand-written. Never edit inside the markers — edit the source and regenerate.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Generated file or region | Block marker | Source of truth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/reference/cron-jobs.md` | `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: cron-jobs -->` | `agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json` and `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json` |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/concepts/autonomous-watchdogs.md`, `docs/site/src/content/docs/concepts/skills.md`, `docs/site/src/content/docs/reference/cron-jobs.md` | `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: cron-job-example -->` | The `compliance-audit` entry of `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json`, rendered as fenced JSON |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/skills/index.mdx` | `{/* BEGIN GENERATED: skill-catalog */}` (MDX comment syntax) | `name`/`description` frontmatter of every `agents/platform/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `agents/cluster/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/docker-images.md` | `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: container-images -->` | `images.json` |
| `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json` — the SOP length and checks-section line range each governance prompt cites | none: `scripts/generate_sop_geography.py` rewrites the digits in place (`make docs-generate` runs it first) | The `agents/platform/governance/*_sop.md` each prompt names |

CI enforcement: `make docs-check` runs the same checks as
`.github/workflows/docs-check.yml` —

- `docs-check-generated` — `scripts/generate_sop_geography.py --check` and
  `scripts/generate_docs.py --check`; fails if a generated region or prompt
  line pin no longer matches its source.
- `docs-check-links` — `scripts/check_docs_links.py`; relative links must
  resolve to **git-tracked** targets, and a `docs/designs/…` or
  `docs/architecture/…` path cited from a code or configuration file (Python,
  Go, shell, Dockerfiles, YAML, Terraform, TypeScript) must be one too. The
  same script holds the **reachability rule**: every tracked `.md`/`.mdx`
  outside a root-level dot-directory must be reachable from where a reader
  starts. The starting points are files at the repository root, any
  `README.md` (its directory reaches it), the tooling under the root
  dot-directories, the site pages Starlight's sidebar lists (read from
  `docs/site/astro.config.mjs`: every page under an autogenerated directory,
  every page a sidebar entry names, and the 404 page), the uniform families the script
  names by glob — the agents' personas, SOPs, skills and skill references, the
  onboarding templates, the GitOps template's per-directory documents and the
  integrity sweep's report and adjudication beside each committed bench run
  record — and every design document a code file cites. From there reach follows
  relative links, site routes and repository blob URLs (the generated skill
  catalogue's form), written as a Markdown link, a reference-style definition,
  an autolink or an `href` attribute (the site's hub pages link by
  `<LinkCard href=...>`). A document linked only from documents no reader reaches
  is reported like one linked from nowhere. The documents that were
  unreachable when the rule arrived are named in the script's allowlist, which
  only shrinks: an entry that becomes reachable, becomes exempt by shape, or is
  deleted fails the check until it is dropped. A new document is linked from
  the page that owns its topic, not listed anywhere.
- `docs-check-terminology` — `hack/check-docs-terminology.sh`; identifiers in
  prose must match their source (service-account names, versions, the
  fleet-audit finding-id pattern and rendering caps, …).
- `docs-check-audience` — `scripts/check_docs_audience.py`; no page under
  `docs/site/src/content/docs/` may match a shape in
  `scripts/docs_audience_denylist.txt` (workflow secret and variable names, App
  and installation IDs, the maintainers' Prow project, internal repositories),
  name a project ID `hack/ci-env.sh` exports (the evaluation pool), or name a
  service-account email in a non-placeholder project; it also fails when it
  finds no site page or derives no project ID. The rule is
  `.agents/rules/documentation.md`.
- `docs-check-context-budget` — `scripts/check_context_budget.py`; `AGENTS.md`
  plus `CLAUDE.md` are loaded into every agent session before the first prompt,
  and their combined size must stay inside the `BUDGET` that file sets.

### Identifier sources

Docs state identifiers — names, defaults, versions, paths — as fact, and each
identifier has exactly one source file. Verify a doc's claim against the
source, never against another doc. The `review-docs-drift` skill classifies a
PR that touches one of these files as a change to documented identifiers and
uses this table to find what to re-verify; when a new category of documented
identifier appears, add its source here.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Identifier | Source of truth |
| --- | --- |
| Kubernetes service-account names | `scripts/installer/common.sh` |
| GCP service-account names an install creates, release namespace, GKE CMEK key ring and key | `install.defaults.env` |
| Defaults an install gets for saying nothing (region, cluster, permission set, registry prefix) | `install.defaults.env` |
| Content-workspace ceilings and reclaim (`CREDENTIAL_PROXY_MAX_WORKSPACES`, `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_MAX_CLONE_BYTES`, `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_WORKSPACE_IDLE_SECONDS`) | `DEFAULT_*` and `_limit` in `agents/platform/scripts/content_workspace.py` |
| The credential proxy's child memory budget terms (the broker and Envoy resident reserve, the content workspace reserve, the per-request child reserve, the output copies per command, the fewest requests a usable budget admits) | `BROKER_RESIDENT_RESERVE_BYTES`, `CONTENT_WORKSPACE_RESERVE_BYTES`, `REQUEST_CHILD_MEMORY_RESERVE_BYTES`, `OUTPUT_COPIES_PER_COMMAND` and `BUDGET_MINIMUM_ADMITTED_REQUESTS` in `agents/platform/scripts/credential_proxy.py`; the operator's `credentialProxy*ReserveBytes`, `credentialProxyOutputCopiesPerCommand` and `credentialProxyMinimumAdmittedRequests` in `k8s-operator/internal/controller/credential_proxy_manifests.go` must match them, held equal by `tests/test_credential_proxy_sizing_parity.py` |
| Go toolchain version | `k8s-operator/go.mod` (and `a2a/go.mod`, kept in step) for building the operator; `scripts/installer/min_versions.sh` (`MIN_GO_VERSION`) for the host that imports the GitHub App key, which builds the Minty CLI and not the operator |
| The drift audit topic, subscription and sink names | `topic_name`, `subscription_name` and `sink_name` in `terraform/modules/drift-pubsub/variables.tf`; `drift_pubsub_topic`, `drift_pubsub_subscription` and `drift_pubsub_sink` in `terraform/examples/full-install/variables.tf` default to the same strings, and `defaultSubscriptionName` in `k8s-operator/cmd/drift-detector/main.go` mirrors the subscription's, and `EVAL_DRIFT_SUBSCRIPTION` in `hack/ci-deploy.sh` restates it for the eval install; `tests/test_drift_subscription_wiring.py` and `tests/test_ci_deploy_drift_detector.py` hold the copies together |
| The two drift switches and the rule between them: the ingress, the consumer, and the fact that the second is refused without the first | `enable_drift_pubsub` and `enable_drift_detector` in `terraform/examples/full-install/variables.tf`, and the `helm_release` preconditions in its `main.tf`; `DEFAULT_ENABLE_DRIFT_DETECTOR` in `install.defaults.env` for the single `install.env` key the front doors write both from; `driftDetectorEnabled` in `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go` for what the operator does with the field afterwards; `tests/test_drift_subscription_wiring.py` pins the composition side |
| The drift batch join budget and the ack deadline it must fit inside | `defaultBatchJoinBudget`, `batchJoinBudgetCeiling` and `maxBudgetShareOfAckDeadline` in `k8s-operator/cmd/drift-detector/subscriber.go`; `ack_deadline_seconds` in `terraform/modules/drift-pubsub/variables.tf`. The detector reads the deadline at startup and warns when the budget takes more than half of it, but does not adopt it, so a doc stating one states both |
| A2A wire constants: protocol version, stream names, size thresholds, token grammar | `a2a/lib/envelope.go` and `a2a/lib/topics.go` |
| Executor terminal reason tokens (`reason: <token>`) and their infrastructure/persona classification | `INFRASTRUCTURE_REASONS` and `PERSONA_REASONS` in `bench/kube_agents_bench/inject_transport.py`; written by `a2a/hermes-bridge/bridge.go` (`failureReason` and the `reason:` constants), `a2a/hermes-bridge/api.go` (`runTaskAPI` and `finalizeAPIError`) and `a2a/worker-adapter/adapter.go`; the lists in `docs/designs/eval-next-transport.md`, `docs/designs/spec-chatops-gateway.md` and `bench/README.md` must agree |
| A2A subject grammar: the task subject classes (`in`, `events`, `supervisor`), their constructors and the parse that recovers addressee, taskId and class | `a2a/lib/client.go` |
| The A2A gateway process's env (backend selection, Slack token pair and allowlist, gchat relay and allowlist, display mode, addressee, and the relay token path it reads) | `a2a/gateway/config.go` (`FromEnv`) |
| The operator's mirror of that backend selection for the gateway render: the Chat and Slack arming rules (`a2aChatArmed`, `a2aSlackArmed`) and their legacy complements, the `discord-bot` Secret name, the Slack token and allowlist env names, the `a2a-slack-principal-map` Secret name, the principal-map path and which one table the gateway mounts there (`a2aPrincipalMapVolumeSource`: the Secret alone when Slack is armed, the hand-made `principal-map` ConfigMap otherwise), the broker env names the Chat render sets and the relay token path, the `A2AGateway` condition and its `NoChatBackend` reason, and the `BusProvisioned` record beside them | `a2aGatewayBackend` and the constants beside it in `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_manifests.go`; it must agree with `a2a/gateway/config.go` |
| The gateway's `verifiedBy` values, the doors' principal-map key prefixes and eval value namespace, and the doors' HTTP paths | `verifiedByFor` in `a2a/gateway/gchat.go`; the prefixes in `a2a/gateway/inject.go` and `a2a/gateway/a2adoor.go`; the inject door's paths in `a2a/gateway/inject.go` and the A2A door's in `a2a/gateway/a2awire.go` |
| Credential-proxy relay env vars, audiences, and route roles | reader `agents/platform/scripts/credential_proxy.py` (`serve`, `build_authenticator`, `ROUTE_ROLES`); the audience values are written by `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_broker_split.go`, and the session audience also by `a2a/gateway/spawn.go`, which projects it |
| The bus principal set: every NATS user the A2A fabric issues or renders, which are static and which authenticate through the callout, and the subject grants each one gets | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_identities.go` (the rendered map and the surviving static users), `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_manifests.go` (the `a2a*JetStreamGrants` functions each identity's JetStream API subjects are built from) and `a2a/authcallout/session.go` (the per-session grants, which are in no map) |
| The bus token contract: the audience a bus token must carry, the path the projected volume delivers it on, and its expiry | `a2a/lib/credentials.go` (client side); `A2ABusTokenAudience` and the bus Secret names in `k8s-operator/api/v1alpha1/common_types.go` (shared by the webhook and the render); `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_callout.go` (the path and expiry the operator projects); the two sides must agree or every client is refused at connect |
| The name of the env var carrying the agent container's bus principal (`A2A_BUS_USER`) | `a2aBusUserEnv` in `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_identities.go` (writer) and `lib.EnvBusUser` in `a2a/lib/credentials.go` (reader, via `busUser()` in `a2a/cmd/a2a/main.go`); the two must agree or the CLI finds no identity, falls through to an unset `NATS_USER`, and exits `no bus identity` before it dials |
| The capability envelope's identifiers: the KV bucket and its stream/subject names, the key grammar and the root/hop key builders, the depth bound, the tier names and the verb-to-tier table, and the verify/reply subject grammar | `a2a/capability/store.go` (`Bucket`, `Stream`, `SubjectPrefix`, `RootKey`, `HopKey`, `MaxDepth`, and the `Minter`), `a2a/capability/verb.go` (the `Tier` values and `verbTier`), `a2a/capability/entry.go` (the entry a verifier reads) and `a2a/capability/service.go` (`ReplyPrefix`, `ReplySubject`, `VerifySubject`). `a2a/gateway/authority.go` (`mintCapability`) is the only code that mints a root, and it fills tier and scope from the gateway's own config rather than from anything about who asked |
| The env the operator writes into a CR-authored A2A sidecar (`POD_NAMESPACE`, `A2A_CAPABILITY_REQUIRED`), and which of the two beats a CR value (`A2A_CAPABILITY_REQUIRED` does; `POD_NAMESPACE` is only a default) | `a2aExecutorSidecarEnv` in `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_callout.go` (writer; the precedence is `mergeEnvVars` in `manifest_helpers.go`, whose second argument wins), read by `capabilityScope()` in `a2a/cmd/hermes-bridge/main.go` and by the bridge config's capability switch in `a2a/hermes-bridge/` |
| The A2A JetStream stream limits: each stream's subjects, retention, byte cap, `max_consumers` and `max_msgs_per_subject`, including the ones derived from `spec.harness.tuning.maxSessions` and the bridge sidecar's `BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_manifests.go` (the rendered provision script and the constants above it); `docs/designs/spec-nats-deployment.md` argues the numbers but does not set them |
| Minimum supported tool versions (`gcloud`, `terraform`, `go`) | `scripts/installer/min_versions.sh` |
| Toolsets, plugins, and MCP servers of an agent profile | that profile's `config.yaml` (`agents/platform/`, `agents/chat/`, `agents/cluster/`) |
| Cron job rosters and schedules | `agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json` and `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json` |
| Persona rules and `§N` section numbering | the profile's `SOUL.md` |
| RBAC bindings and KSA defaults laid down per agent | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go` |
| `app.kubernetes.io/*` label values on installed objects | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/manifest_helpers.go`, each `kustomization.yaml`, and `a2a/gateway/spawn.go` (gateway-spawned session pods) |
| The mode switch's key, values, and skew reason (`KUBEAGENTS_MODE`, `today`/`next`, `ModeNotRecognized`) | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/mode.go` and `platformagent_manifests.go` (writer), `agents/platform/scripts/runtime_mode.py` (reader) |
| Controller permissions | `k8s-operator/config/rbac/` |
| The operator RBAC self-check: the `RBACIncomplete` reason, its re-check interval and condition message; the floating tags `make deploy` refuses and `ALLOW_MUTABLE_IMG` | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/rbac_selfcheck.go`; `k8s-operator/Makefile` |
| `make` targets | the root `Makefile` and `k8s-operator/Makefile` |
| The third-party download retry rule: which files are walked and what flags a curl line must carry | `DOWNLOAD_SOURCES`, `RETRY_COUNT` and `RETRY_ALL_ERRORS` in `tests/test_third_party_download_retry.py` |
| Harness discovery of this repository's own skills: the `.claude/*` symlink targets, and the floor a lifecycle skill's description must clear | `CLAUDE_LINKS`, `LIFECYCLE_ACTIONS` and `PRODUCT` in `tests/test_skill_discovery.py` |
| The GitHub environment variables an install is configured from, which install.env key each becomes, and which are required to reconcile a long-lived environment | `MAPPING`, `REQUIRED_ALWAYS` and `REQUIRED_STRICT` in `scripts/release/render_install_env.sh` |
| Paths baked into the agent image (`/opt/defaults/...`) | `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` |
| The version-control verb surface: which verbs exist, which are broker-side and which are collaboration, and the members of the forge provider protocol | `agents/platform/scripts/providers/base.py` (`BROKER_VERBS`, `COLLABORATION_VERBS`) and `agents/platform/scripts/forge.py` (`ForgeProvider`); the route table in `vcs_broker.py` is what the broker actually serves |
| The maintainers' CI project IDs, which `docs-check-audience` forbids on the site | `hack/ci-env.sh` (the `PROJECT_ID` export) |
| Image-patch module names and the behaviour they add | the module's own docstring under `deploy/docker/patches/`, plus the `COPY`/`RUN` list in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` |
| Bundled Hermes platform plugins the image installs (no patch) | the plugin's own `adapter.py` docstring under `deploy/docker/plugins/`, plus the `COPY`/`RUN` list in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` |
| Slack bot token scopes an install must grant | upstream `_build_full_manifest` in `hermes_cli/slack_cli.py` as patched by `deploy/docker/patches/apply_slack_reactions_scope.py`; the one prose copy, in `INSTALL.md`, must match it (`scripts/installer/print_instructions_slack.sh` defers to `hermes slack manifest` and carries no copy) |
| What pod start-up force-syncs from the image vs. preserves on the PV | `deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh` |
| Shared agent defaults (`approvals.*`, `security.*`) | `deploy/shared/defaults/config.yaml` and `renderConfigYAML()` in `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go` |
| Image defaults and override env vars (`PLATFORM_AGENT_IMAGE` et al.) | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/manifest_helpers.go` |
