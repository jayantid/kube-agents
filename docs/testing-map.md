# Where tests go

`AGENTS.md` owns the rule: decide by asking whether a model call is in the loop. This page is the
mechanics behind it — the full set of homes, what runs each one, and the traps that make a
misplaced test look fine.

## The eleven homes

Some of those rows carry a footnote that matters more than the row.

**`make test-python` runs twice in CI, on two interpreters.** `python-tests.yml`'s required job runs
it under coverage on `.python-version`, CI's Python, and a second, non-required job runs it plain on
`.agent-python-version`, the Python inside the platform agent image, where `agents/platform/scripts`,
`deploy/shared` and the agent plugins execute. A suite that passes on one and not the other is the
second job's whole purpose; it replaced two workflows that ran only `tests/` and the plugin suites
on that interpreter. It is not a required check, so it holds no merge, but a red on `main` fails the
workflow run and files a main-broken issue like any other job in it.

**`bench/tasks/` and `bench/cuj/` both drive an agent, and they are the two most confusable rows.**
The difference is who supplies the failure and who owns the environment.

A `bench/tasks/` case is an **eval, and it runs in CI**, in the Prow presubmit or the Prow nightly periodic tier (`ci-kube-agents-eval-nightly`). It plants a defect and the
run owns the environment the defect sits in: the case's `infrastructure.deployer` decides where,
with `tofu` provisioning a stack for the run and tearing it down after, and `noop` grading against
the cluster the deploy already stood up. The agent is pointed at it and its diagnosis is graded
against the case's `verification_spec`. The subject is the agent — the defect is known, and what is
in question is whether the agent finds it. That is why a case needs a `domain:` slug and
deterministic checks, and why adding one changes what a pull request reports.

A `bench/cuj/` journey is a **manual tier: a live black-box test you run by hand against your own
install, never part of the presubmit**. It plants nothing and provisions nothing. It talks to Kage
as a user through the admin portal API and scores only evidence the deployed system returned, so the
subject is the install: the agent is assumed to work, and what is in question is whether this
deployment is wired up. It needs a real installation to point at, which is why no CI job runs it,
why adding one changes nothing about what a pull request reports, and why it cannot gate anything.

Being manual is the design rather than a gap someone will automate later. The tier is what you reach
for after an install or an upgrade, to confirm the deploy landed, and while working a bug on a live
system — the cases where the question is about one deployment and no amount of CI could answer it.
Write a journey expecting to run it yourself, and do not expect anything to run it for you.

Rule of thumb: if you would have to break something on purpose for the test to be meaningful, it is
a `bench/tasks/` case. If you would run it against production to check the deploy landed, it is a
`bench/cuj/` journey.

**The two paths-filtered workflows report `success` on a pull request that ran nothing.**
`k8s-operator-test.yml` and `a2a-test.yml` both run `dorny/paths-filter` and then gate
every subsequent step on the result, so the job always completes and the check always goes green.
`k8s-operator-test.yml`'s own header comment says it: the job "reports `success` on a pull request
that ran no tests". A change that breaks an operator contract from outside `k8s-operator/**` gets a
green `Run Controller Tests` that compiled nothing.

**In `a2a/`, the tests that prove the bus's authorization model are the ones that skip.**
The auth callout's suite has three tiers and only the first runs everywhere. Tests that
stand up an embedded `nats-server` against a fake clientset need nothing, and that includes
the end-to-end connect through the callout. Tests that need the `nats` CLI on `PATH` are the
JetStream-API escape probes.
Tests that stand up a real API server — the pod-bound token claims, the end-to-end connect
through the callout, a whole session run under its own derived grants — need
`KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS`, and they `t.Skip` without it. `make verify` sets neither, so it reports
green on a change that broke every one of them. `a2a-test.yml` installs both, which is what
actually gates; locally, run

```
KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS="$(make -C k8s-operator -s envtest-path)" go test ./...
```

from `a2a/` before believing a security change in that module. A fourth tier,
`a2a/worker-adapter/live_test.go` and `a2a/gateway/live_test.go`, needs a real install and is
gated on `A2A_LIVE_NATS_URL`; nothing automatic runs it.

**`tests/e2e/` is not manual-only.** `rc-scheduler.yml` runs on `cron: "17 */3 * * *"` and
dispatches `rc-release-pipeline.yml` whenever a new candidate exists, and
`step-4-tag-validated` depends on the suite. Breaking a test there is not free — it reds the
release-candidate pipeline within three hours and stops the tag. Both it and `staging-promotion-pipeline.yml`
reach the suite through the same reusable `e2e-run.yml`; `e2e-gchat-test.yml` and
`e2e-manual-runner.yml` are the by-hand callers. `tests/e2e/operator/agentplugins_e2e_test.py` is
the exception inside the exception: it is the whole of the `agent-plugin` suite and is in the
`nightly` E2E test set too, and `staging-promotion-pipeline.yml` runs `agent-plugin` as tolerated coverage
rather than as its gate — so the scheduler dispatches the pipeline daily when an eligible
candidate exists, so it does run automatically — and nothing fails when it does.

**A `*_e2e_test.py` suffix opts a plugin test out of CI, and `test_*.py` opts it in.**
The `agentplugins/*/tests/test_*.py` glob in `PYTHON_TEST_DIRS` matches `test_*.py`, which
deliberately does not match the `*_e2e_test.py` suites sitting in the same directory. Naming a live-infrastructure test
`test_dedup_e2e.py` rather than `dedup_e2e_test.py` joins it to the pull-request suite, where it
needs a Pub/Sub topic that CI does not have.

## Disambiguating scheduled and periodic jobs

Multiple automated jobs run on timers or tags across Prow and GitHub Actions. Several share the
colloquial name "nightly" despite running on different platforms, with different triggers, budgets,
and purposes:

| Job                              | Platform        | Trigger                                                 | Input                                     | What it produces                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rc-release-pipeline.yml`        | GitHub Actions  | `rc-scheduler.yml`, `cron: "17 */3 * * *"`              | A commit on `main`                        | `rc_<ts>_<sha>`, then `rc_<ts>_<sha>_validated`                                                                                    |
| `staging-promotion-pipeline.yml` | GitHub Actions  | `staging-promotion-scheduler.yml`, `cron: "17 2 * * *"` | A validated `rc_` tag                     | The E2E matrix, then an `evalcand_` tag that nominates the commit for the eval below, then, on a green verdict, the `staging_` tag |
| `post-kube-agents-eval-rc`       | Prow postsubmit | An `evalcand_` tag push                                 | Nominated candidate commit (`evalcand_*`) | A verdict on that candidate against the merge-blocking presubmit matrix, not the full catalog (360m budget, parallelism 4)         |
| `ci-kube-agents-eval-nightly`    | Prow periodic   | `cron: "0 0 * * *"`                                     | Latest `main`                             | Baseline evidence store and dashboard rows against the eval catalog (480m budget, parallelism 6)                                   |
| `ci-kube-agents-pool-pressure`   | Prow periodic   | `cron: "23 * * * *"`                                    | None (leases nothing)                     | Pool health verification                                                                                                           |

When diagnosing failures or reporting incidents, name the specific job rather than saying "the nightly":

`ci-kube-agents-eval-nightly` is the Prow periodic eval grading `main` against the full evaluation catalog (`presubmit-cases.txt` plus `nightly-cases.txt`).

`staging-promotion-pipeline.yml` is the GitHub Actions workflow that runs the full E2E matrix and promotes validated release candidates to staging.

`post-kube-agents-eval-rc` grades nominated candidates against the merge-blocking presubmit matrix, the tier the pull-request gate runs, not the full catalog the nightly runs (`hack/ci-eval-rc.sh` pins `RC_EVAL_TIER`; the reason is the 360m budget, [`docs/designs/testing-strategy.md`](designs/testing-strategy.md)), under a postsubmit trigger and lower task parallelism (4 vs 6); neither failure implies the other, and a regression only a nightly-only case would catch reaches staging and is reported by the nightly afterwards.

## Running on a pull request is not gating a merge

The last column says what a trigger and its `if:` conditions support, which is a weaker claim than
"blocks the merge". Which checks are actually required lives in branch protection on
`gke-labs/kube-agents` and in Prow config in `GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra`; neither is a file
in this repository, so this table asserts nothing about either.
[`pull-request-workflow.md`](pull-request-workflow.md#how-a-change-merges) names the required
contexts as they stand, gives the command to read them back, and says why that command sees only
the branch-protection half of the set. `make verify` (the `verify` target in the root `Makefile`) is the
local answer to the same question — everything a pull request must pass offline, in one target —
and [`pull-request-workflow.md`](pull-request-workflow.md#local-validation-before-committing) lists
the individual targets to run when you have touched a given area.

Per-tier detail lives with each tier: [`bench/cuj/README.md`](../bench/cuj/README.md) for adding a
journey, [`tests/integration/README.md`](../tests/integration/README.md) for the seam tier,
[`tests/e2e/README.md`](../tests/e2e/README.md) for the release gate, and
[`bench/README.md`](../bench/README.md) for running the evals that already exist.

For an eval case, [`bench-case-format.md`](designs/bench-case-format.md) is the contract and this
page does not restate it. It rules on what a `task.yaml` must carry — the `id`, the mandatory
`domain:` slug, `owner:` and `verification_spec`, the exact-versus-judged line, and which keys red
a build —
and `make bench-case-check` checks it in about a second before you push. The target itself
runs in no workflow: `scripts/test_task_registration.py` calls the same validator and
asserts it returned no findings, and that lint is what gates, through `PYTHON_TEST_DIRS`
and `python-tests.yml`. Read the contract before writing a case;
[`bench/CUSTOM-TASKS.md`](../bench/CUSTOM-TASKS.md) is the walkthrough that sits under it.

## The trap that spans every tier

**A new test directory that no wildcard reaches never runs.** `make test-python` discovers from
`PYTHON_TEST_DIRS`, a list of globs in the `Makefile`. A directory the globs miss fails
nothing — it sits unexecuted and the suite reports green around it, which is how eight test files
stayed unrun for months. Adding a directory means adding its glob in the same change.
`scripts/test_test_discovery.py` fails the build if you forget, and its `EXCLUDED` dict is where a
directory goes that must deliberately not run, with the reason it must not.

This is the one that catches people who put a test in a reasonable-looking place. The equivalent
traps for eval cases — a missing `domain:` slug counting as coverage of nothing, and a presubmit
seat before the activation blockers in [`../bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md`](../bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md)
clear — are in [`bench-case-format.md`](designs/bench-case-format.md), enforced rather than
described.
