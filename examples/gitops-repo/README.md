# Reference GitOps repository layout

This is the **template customers fork** as their kube-agents GitOps repo — the single source of truth
for desired state (`05` C13). It is separate from the kube-agents source tree; agents check it out
dynamically into the agent workspace and `submit-suggestion` opens PRs against it. Layout defined in
[`docs/architecture/06-api-and-data-contracts.md` §3](../../docs/architecture/06-api-and-data-contracts.md).

```
gitops-repo/
├── clusters/<cluster>/            # per-cluster desired state (applied by that target's pipeline)
│   ├── provisioning/              # cloud/cluster resources: KCC YAML or Terraform HCL
│   ├── namespaces/<ns>/           # Namespace, RBAC, NetworkPolicy, ResourceQuota, workloads

```

## Contracts

- **Propose** (`submit-suggestion`): branch `<tier>-agent/<change_type>-<target>` → stage only
  targeted files (never `git add .`) → Conventional Commit → PR.
- **Apply:** on merge, the **customer's CI/CD** applies changed paths — `kubectl apply` for K8s/KCC
  YAML, `terraform apply` for HCL. kube-agents never calls cluster/cloud APIs directly.
- **Review gate:** PRs touching `**/provisioning/**`, `**/agents/**`, `**/namespaces/**`,
  `**/policy/**`, `knowledge/**` and `.kube-agents/**` require human review (see `CODEOWNERS.example` —
  copy to `CODEOWNERS` and fill in real teams when forking) + the security review gate (06 §7).
  `knowledge/` is in the gate because a note there can move an audit posture off the ledger
  (next bullet); a declaration is a reviewed change, not a comment. `.kube-agents/` is in it
  because `intent.yaml` decides which paths' notes can do that, and removing the file opens the
  whole repository to them, so the bound carries the same review as the notes it bounds.
- **Declared intent:** the declaring audit streams read `knowledge/` — and the obtainability
  stream `clusters/<cluster>/provisioning/` as well — before they report a posture an owner may
  have chosen: a fixed replica count,
  a pinned HPA or a missing PodDisruptionBudget (`agents/platform/governance/obtainability_audit_sop.md` §4a),
  a namespace with no NetworkPolicy or a workload on the default ServiceAccount's token
  (`compliance_audit_sop.md` §3a, object `Namespace/<ns>` or the workload's `Kind/name`),
  a cluster off its release channel, without a maintenance window or upgrade notifications, under a
  change freeze, or a node pool with auto-upgrade or auto-repair off
  (`security_patch_orchestrator_sop.md` §4a, object `Cluster/<name>` or `NodePool/<pool>`, and `namespace: ""` written out, as that SOP's
  §4a spells it), a
  reservation the waste audit would report: headroom above a workload's peak, a kept volume,
  disk or address, warm node capacity, an idle namespace or standby, a registry with no cleanup
  policy (`fleet_wide_cost_analysis_sop.md` §3a, object as the finding names it, and `namespace`
  empty for a node pool, an idle namespace and the project-scoped disk, address and registry
  repository; a namespace written on any of those five is read as empty; a cost declaration
  covers the object at any size, and the Declared intent row shows the size the collector measured).
  A choice HCL cannot express — a workload meant to run one replica — goes in an OKF document
  (`type` frontmatter, 06 §5) under `knowledge/` as a `declares:` list in the frontmatter, one item
  per posture with `check` (the slug, `single-replica`), `namespace`, `object` as `Kind/name`, and
  `cluster` when the choice is one cluster's rather than fleet-wide, spelled as the qualified
  `<project>/<location>/<name>` every stream's findings carry, never the bare name; the audit reads the
  frontmatter, never the prose, and lists a match under _Declared intent_ with the file's path
  instead of reporting it. `.kube-agents/intent.yaml` names the paths the audit reads for such
  notes (`knowledge/` here); without it, or when a named path has nothing behind it, the whole
  repository is read, and in content mode copied whole under the audit's file and byte caps, so naming paths is what keeps a large repository
  searchable. A Terraform repository that
  is not this one is registered under the `context_repos` key of the agent's `gitops-state`
  ConfigMap, optionally pinned to a branch with `ref`, and is read the same way, never written to.
- **Version pins:** kube-agents artifacts referenced from this repo are pinned to immutable SemVer
  releases — Terraform modules via
  `git::https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents.git//terraform/modules/<name>?ref=1.2.0`, the Helm
  chart via `oci://ghcr.io/gke-labs/kube-agents/charts/kube-agents --version 1.2.0`, container
  images via `1.2.0` tags — never `:latest` or a branch ref. Canonical rules:
  [release versioning & promotion](../../docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/release-versioning.md).

`cluster-a/` and its `namespaces/team-x/` are illustrative scaffolding, not a live target.
