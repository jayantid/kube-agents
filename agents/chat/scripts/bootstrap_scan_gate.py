"""Dispatcher for the ``bootstrap-inventory-scan`` cron job.

First-time onboarding needs a full GKE discovery sweep (control plane options,
node pools, Workload Identity, running workloads): ``bootstrap_handoff.py``
files one audit card per Cluster Agent and writes their findings to
``INVENTORY.raw.md``, the sweep card lists the fleet and audits clusters with
no Cluster Agent, and a second card ranks it all into the short report the user
receives. The audits are LLM work AND privileged work, and the
profile this cron runs on can do neither: the Chat Agent's toolsets are
deliberately stripped to ``mcp-router`` + ``kanban`` (no terminal, no gcloud,
no kubectl), so it cannot run the sweep itself even as an LLM job.

Nor can the job simply move to ``platform``. Every marker that makes onboarding
once-only — ``.bootstrap_scan_filed`` below, ``.bootstrap_greeted`` and
``.bootstrap_completed`` — lives in the Chat Agent's home, and a
job on the platform profile would gate itself on a different directory. (Cron
on a named profile does now fire, via ``profile_cron_tick.py``; that is no
longer the reason this lives here.)

So this runs as a ``no_agent`` script — a plain subprocess, not bound by the
Chat Agent's toolset denylist — and files the sweep as a **kanban task assigned
to** ``platform``, the privileged specialist. The dispatcher spawns that worker
with its full toolset; the worker lists the fleet, audits any cluster with no
Cluster Agent, and completes its own card. ``bootstrap_handoff.py``, on this
job's ticks, files one audit card per Cluster Agent, waits for them, writes the
raw findings, and files the prioritization card.

Filing is once-only, and this job owns that guarantee locally: the id of the
card it filed is recorded in ``.bootstrap_scan_filed``, and while that marker
exists no further card is ever filed. The board's ``idempotency_key`` is kept
as a second line of defence for the one window the marker cannot cover (the
card was created but the run died before the marker was written) — but it is
not the guarantee. It cannot be: it dedupes against non-archived rows in one
board's database, so an archived card, a recreated board, or a reset volume
would hand a 1-minute cron job licence to launch a fresh fleet-wide sweep
every single minute. That is the "bootstrap ran several times" failure.

The marker is also what makes a delegated sweep safe, and that is what broke
here. When the sweep first fanned out to subagents, the card this job filed
completed almost immediately — the worker of that era delegated to
per-cluster child cards plus an aggregation card and finished, so the board
said "done" while the disk said "no report" for the whole sweep, which is
indistinguishable from "never scanned" — and a 1-minute job with no memory of
its own re-filed the sweep, once a minute, for as long as the real work took.
The sweep card completes long before the audits do, and the
raw file and the prioritization card (or, with nothing audited, the report
itself) come from the hand-off minutes later, so
board-done/disk-empty is the normal middle of a sweep. Only a marker written at
file time covers every case.

Archiving the previous run's ``bootstrap-inventory-*`` cards and then deleting
``.bootstrap_scan_filed`` — together with ``INVENTORY.raw.md``, which nothing
else ever removes and which a reader would take for this run's findings
(``should_skip`` checks it too, but sees it only with the shell sandbox off) —
is the supported way
to re-arm discovery after a sweep has genuinely failed (the runbook is
bootstrap_onboarding/README.md §5). Deleting the marker alone leaves the gate
closed; deleting it without archiving lets the board answer the new sweep card's
create with the old card, so no sweep runs.

While the marker exists and ``.bootstrap_completed`` does not, each tick runs
the hand-off instead of filing; it is a no-op once it has filed its card.

Output is intentionally empty: ``deliver: local`` plus empty stdout means the
scheduler treats every run as silent. The report reaches the user through
``bootstrap_delivery.py``, not through this job.

    """The ready Cluster Agents, one ``{name, key, title, cluster_label}`` each.

    The gate files one card per entry itself (``bootstrap_handoff``) and lists
    them in the sweep card. It reads the roster because the sweep's worker cannot. The worker's
    ``terminal`` runs in the shell sandbox, which has no ``hermes``, and whose
    ``/opt/data/profiles`` is a mirror that leaves out every ``config.yaml``
    (so no ``cluster_identity``) and keeps profiles the reconcile has pruned.
    This process runs in the agent pod next to the real profiles, and only
    after ``ensure_cluster_agents`` returns True, so the list is the ready part
    of the roster the reconcile left, or once it has given up, of whatever
    roster exists.

    ``cluster_agent_profile`` resolves the profiles under this process's
    ``HERMES_HOME``, the same root the markers and the reconcile use, so it
    follows ``spec.harness.hermes.agentHome``.

    A profile is listed only when it meets ``platform_control``'s
    ``list_cluster_profiles`` rule: registered with Hermes and its scaffold
    finished. A card assigned to an unregistered directory is never dispatched
    and the hand-off waits on it until its time limit; a profile without
    ``USER.md`` blocks at preflight, and its cluster is better audited by the
    sweep itself in Step 3.

    A profile without a readable ``cluster_identity`` is left out, as the
    reconcile neither counts nor prunes one: there is no cluster to name on its
    card, and the card already sends every cluster the list misses to Step 3. A
    profile whose directory or config cannot be read is skipped the same way: a
    file like that is what keeps the reconcile failing until it gives up and
    files the sweep, so it must not take the other profiles with it. An entry
    whose stat fails with EACCES or EIO fails ``list_profiles`` itself, below;
    ``list_profiles`` leaves out a dangling symlink.

    Failing to list the profiles, or to import the readiness rule, returns an
    empty list, which files the solo sweep. Raising would fail the run before
    the card is filed, on every tick for as long as the failure lasts; like
    the give-up in ``ensure_cluster_agents``, this gate prefers a degraded
    report to none.
