"""Dispatcher for the ``oobe`` cron job: the work an install does once, on first boot.

The design is ``docs/designs/oobe.md``. Today the job has one stage, the first-run
audits: once the onboarding inventory scan has settled, run the four fleet audits
that would otherwise wait for their schedules (the next 06:20 UTC, the next Monday
for cost), one after another. The bootstrap scan and delivery jobs still run beside it.

The stage fires when the scan's ranking card has finished, read from the board. It
does not wait for delivery, which needs a human message, and it does not look for
the report file, which is on the sandbox's volume when the sandbox is on. A scan
that has not settled by the hand-off's own deadline plus ``RANKING_ALLOWANCE_SECONDS``
after its sweep was filed fires anyway.

The audits run as a chain, in ``FIRST_RUN_AUDITS`` order: the next is marked due only
once the previous one's run has ended, so no two overlap. The schedule staggers them
for the same reason; four started together on a small install's gateway pod put it
under memory pressure for the best part of an hour. Each is marked due on the
Platform Agent's roster with Hermes' ``cron.jobs.trigger_job``, so the next
``profile-cron-tick`` runs it through its schedule's own path. Not ``hermes cron
run``: that CLI runs the whole job synchronously in the calling process.
``.oobe_audits_fired`` records each one before it is marked, and the mark awaiting
its run, so a run killed partway marks nothing twice: marking an audit due again after it has run
starts a second full run. With no GitOps repository configured every audit fails
before it reads anything, so the stage records the skip and marks none.

``trigger_job`` also sets a job's ``enabled`` back to true, so an audit an operator
has disabled or paused is left alone rather than started.

A read that fails is never taken as an answer: a tick that cannot read the Platform
Agent's run ledger or roster marks nothing and spends no attempt, and the next tick
reads again.

An install whose sweep was filed more than ``NEW_INSTALL_SECONDS`` ago while the
stage has started nothing is not new: it onboarded before this job existed but
never reached delivery, so the entrypoint could not tell. Its audits run on their
schedules. A scan still unsettled after a day (a fleet of hundreds of clusters)
is caught by the same rule.

Once the stage is done, the next run removes the job. Stdout stays empty: the job
delivers locally and never speaks to the user.
