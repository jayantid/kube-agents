"""The onboarding sweep's hand-off to ranking, run by ``bootstrap_scan_gate.py``.

After the gate files the sweep card, this module runs once a minute on the
gate's tick: it files one ``bootstrap-inventory-cluster-*`` card per Cluster
Agent, waits for those cards and the sweep to settle, writes
``INVENTORY.raw.md`` from their structured ``metadata``, and files the
``bootstrap-inventory-prioritize`` card that ranks it into the report the user
receives — or, when no cluster's audit reached the raw file, writes that report
itself, saying so, and files no ranking card. The sweep's worker only lists the fleet and audits any cluster with
no Cluster Agent.

It is code rather than SOP text because each of these steps is mechanical
and the worker could not do them reliably: it has no tool that waits
(``execute_code`` is blocked in single-query mode, and ``sleep`` in the shell
sandbox returns early, #1981), so it closed or blocked its card over running
children; it typed the raw file by hand and left out the ```findings block
``inventory_findings.py extract`` needs; and it filed the ranking card without
its idempotency key.

Once-only, like the sweep: ``.bootstrap_handoff_filed`` records which sweep was
handed off and which ranking card it got (``none`` when it filed none). It names the sweep so that a re-armed
discovery, which deletes ``.bootstrap_scan_filed`` but may not know this marker,
still gets its own hand-off.
