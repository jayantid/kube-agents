# prefix, one per case, each asking for the greeting on every API-server turn
# whose message contains its phrase, until the stack's destroy step removes the
# file. It exists because the bench reaches the gateway over the API server,
# which the platform allowlist above excludes, and because a real install greets
# once. A chat platform's turns never consult it, and a phrase shorter than the
# floor is ignored, so a stray request cannot greet every turn. It is not used up on first match: the harness re-sends the
# opening turn in the same conversation after a dropped connection, and that
# retry is no longer a first turn, so a used-up request would grade the retry's
# ordinary reply as the model's. It touches no onboarding state: no delivery
# binding, no presence or greeted marker, no trigger. Nothing else writes it,
# and with none present this hook runs exactly as it would without the seam. The
# phrase keeps a concurrent eval case's turns from matching another case's
# request. A request more than EVAL_REQUEST_MAX_AGE_SECONDS from its
# written_at (epoch seconds, stamped at apply) is refused with a warning, so
# one a failed destroy leaves behind disarms on its own.
