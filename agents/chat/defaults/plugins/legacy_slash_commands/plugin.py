"""Make a typed ``/hermes <subcommand>`` reach the gateway command dispatcher.

Slack only routes a leading-slash string to Hermes' slash handler when that
slash is registered on the Slack app (Features → Slash Commands, or the
manifest ``hermes slack manifest`` prints). When it is not, Slack delivers the
line as an ordinary channel message, the gateway parses ``/hermes`` as the
command name, finds nothing in ``COMMAND_REGISTRY``, and answers "Unknown
command ``/hermes``" — so ``/hermes sethome`` silently does nothing and the
"no home channel is set" prompt keeps reappearing every session.

The Slack adapter already knows how to unwrap the legacy form: its
``_handle_slash_command`` maps ``/hermes <sub> [args]`` through
``slack_subcommand_map()`` before dispatch. This plugin performs the same
unwrapping one layer earlier — on the inbound ``MessageEvent`` — so the legacy
form behaves identically whether it arrived as a registered slash command or as
plain text, on any platform.
