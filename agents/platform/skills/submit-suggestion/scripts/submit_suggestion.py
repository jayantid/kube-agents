GKE Platform Agent — GitOps PR Suggestion Submitter

Two commands, because a change proposal takes two turns of the agent's shell
and the agent has to know *where* to work in between:

    prepare  -> bring the repository down, take the branch, print the workspace
    (agent edits files in that workspace)
    submit   -> record the change, send it up, open or refresh the proposal

Everything here is the version-control verbs. `prepare` is `clone` plus
`branch`; `submit` is `commit`, `publish` and one of `proposal-create` /
`proposal-update`. There is no `gh` in this file, no token in this container,
and no directory shared with the process that holds the credential.

Three things that used to be here are gone with it, and each is worth naming
because their absence is what makes the rest simple.

**The lease is gone.** It existed because clones lived on a volume six audit
crons and every kanban worker shared, so "which clone is mine" was a real
question with a wrong answer. `clone` writes one copy per repository *and
branch* under this container's own scratch root -- the root is shared, the name
is not -- and refuses to replace a copy holding work that was never published — which is the same protection, taken from the thing being
protected rather than from a file beside it. `--force` is the way past it.

**Content mode is gone.** It was the other answer to "the agent must not author
a `.git/config` the credential process will read", and it bought that by taking
the checkout away from the agent entirely — no `.git`, so no filter driver, no
alias, no hook path. The verbs get the same result the other way round: the
checkout is here and the credential is not, so a hook in it runs against
nothing worth having. With a real repository on disk again, `list` and `fetch`
have nothing to do; `ls` and `cat` are back.

**`--force-with-lease` is gone**, and nothing replaced it. `publish` is
fast-forward only. A second round on a branch extends it; a branch that
diverged is refused by name rather than overwritten.
