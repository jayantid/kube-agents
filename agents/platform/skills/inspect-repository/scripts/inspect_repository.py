"""Read a GitHub repository this pod has no checkout of.

Content-passing took the agent's `.git` away, and with it the ad-hoc `git clone`
that used to be how a question about somebody else's code got answered. The
clone itself was never the point — the point was having the source to read — so
this script gets the source a different way: the broker clones, and the agent
pulls file content out of it over the workspace protocol.

What lands locally is a tree of files with no `.git` in it. That is the whole
difference from the old path, and it is deliberate: a directory with no
repository in it has no `.git/config`, so none of the config-driven ways to make
git execute something exist in it. See docs/designs/agent-shell-sandboxing.md,
"Content-passing removes the shared tree".

Two shapes of use, and they answer different questions.

    inspect_repository.py clone --repo kubernetes-sigs/kustomize
        The whole tree (or a `--prefix` of it) copied into a scratch directory.
        Use it when the analysis is "read this code" and the repository is small
        enough to be worth having on disk.

    inspect_repository.py open --repo kubernetes-sigs/kustomize
    inspect_repository.py grep --handle <h> --pattern 'func NewCmd'
    inspect_repository.py fetch --handle <h> --into ./scratch <paths…>
    inspect_repository.py close --handle <h>
        Search first, then take only the files the search named. Use it on a
        repository too large to copy, which is most of them.

Every subcommand prints one JSON object on stdout.

There are no silent caps anywhere in here. A listing that ended at the broker's
ceiling says `truncated` and the caller pages with a cursor; a file the broker
would not send comes back in `skipped` with the reason. A tool that quietly
returns nine tenths of a repository is worse than one that fails, because the
analysis reads as complete.

On an install whose broker has not been armed for content-passing, `clone` falls
back to a leased checkout on the shared volume — the arrangement that predates
this script — and reports `"mode": "directory"`. The other subcommands need a
broker handle and say so rather than pretending.
