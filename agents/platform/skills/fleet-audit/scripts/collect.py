"""collect.py — Procedural collector for the fleet-audit checks that are code
wearing prose.

The manifest it prints is the contract in
docs/designs/fleet-audit-collector-manifest.md, which `audit_report.py finish
--manifest-file` cross-checks the published document against.

**Scope: three streams' check tables in full.** `obtainability-audit`'s
twenty-four-check roster (§3.1–§3.24 of `governance/obtainability_audit_sop.md`),
`compliance-audit`'s sixteen-check roster (§2.1–§2.16 of
`governance/compliance_audit_sop.md`), and `ai-security-audit`'s six-check
roster (§3.1–§3.6 of `governance/ai_security_audit_sop.md`). Every check the
three SOPs define is mechanical — none needed a `needs_triage` judgment call
to *find*, including ai-security's §3.4, whose severity forks on whether the
same container also trips §3.2, a fact both checks compute from the same dump —
so nothing was left on the SOP side to skip. Four checks' *fixes* do need a
reader -- `netpol-missing`'s remedy is a default-deny NetworkPolicy, for one --
so their candidates carry a marker that keeps the automatic sweep from
opening them (`TRIAGE_BY_SLUG`). Other streams have their own
collectors (`fleet_drift.py`, `patch_readiness.py`) or none. The three streams
collect in different shapes: obtainability answers every check from one
workload dump plus the reads its declaration fields need; compliance issues
several distinct `kubectl` and `gcloud` reads per cluster, three of them
best-effort because their CRDs are not installed everywhere; ai-security reads
a workload dump and a Service dump, the second backing exactly one check
(`inference-endpoint-public`) that joins it against the first.
`collect_cluster` is a thin dispatcher over a per-stream *context builder* for
exactly this reason — the engine below is what every stream shares, not what
the first one happened to need.

What this file does for the checks it covers:

  1. Discovers every project the caller can see (`gcloud projects list`,
     or the one `--project` names) and enumerates each one's clusters
     (`gcloud container clusters list`), naming every cluster
     `<project>/<location>/<name>` because a bare name is unique only inside
     one project and location.
  2. Fetches per-cluster credentials into an isolated kubeconfig — the same
     path convention every SOP already uses (`AGENTS.md`, "Cluster
     Credentials") — then runs the stream's context builder: one dump for
     obtainability, several distinct `kubectl`/`gcloud` reads for
     compliance, two dumps for ai-security, each behind its own fail-closed
     `jq -e`-equivalent gate so a truncated or empty result cannot read as a
     clean cluster.
  3. Runs every covered check's filter against the collected context, in
     parallel across clusters (a thread pool; each cluster's kubeconfig is a
     private file, so no cluster's read can bleed into another's).
  4. Emits the run manifest: for every enumerated cluster, an outcome,
     the literal collection commands (so `checks_run` stays falsifiable),
     and every candidate finding.

The agent's job on a covered check shrinks to: run this script, read the
manifest, and — because every check converted so far is fully mechanical —
copy each candidate into `findings.json`
with the recommendation prose the validator requires. Nothing here writes to
a cluster; every subprocess this module runs is `gcloud`/`kubectl` read
verbs, in the same register `command_policy.py` already allows an agent's
own shell to run.

    Kubernetes 1.33 — a check written against a deprecated kind acquires an
    expiry date on the day it ships. Each slice names its Service in a label,
    so the join is a lookup rather than a walk of `subsets`.

    Joined here for the reason `cronjobs_with_jobs` is: done inside the check,
    the dump would be walked once per Service, which is quadratic in a
    namespace holding hundreds of them.

    Terminating endpoints are not counted. A pod being drained during a rollout
    is still listed in the slice, with `conditions.terminating` set, and
    counting it would make this check read a routine rollout as healthy at the
    exact moment it is not — and, worse, would let a Service that genuinely
    resolves to nothing look fine for as long as one old pod takes to go away.

    `resolved_ports` and `named_targets` serve §3.17 and answer a second
    question off the same join: which of this Service's ports the controller
    could actually resolve. A `targetPort` given as a name is resolved against
    the pod's declared `containerPort`s, and when no container declares that
    name the endpoint-slice controller drops the port from the slice entirely
    rather than writing it with a null number — so a service-port name missing
    from `resolved_ports` is the controller saying it could not resolve it. A
    numeric `targetPort` always resolves and is therefore not collected.

    S1, S2 and S4 are applied, as for CronJobs. S3 is not: an operator-owned
    Service black-holes traffic exactly like a hand-written one, and
    `reconciler` is what tells the reader the fix belongs in the operator's
    chart rather than in the cluster's tree. S5 has no meaning for a Service,

    A second budget over the same pods is not additive protection, which is

    by two PDBs returns 500 -- `This pod has more than one PodDisruptionBudget,
    which the eviction subresource does not support` -- so `kubectl drain`,
    node-pool upgrades, auto-repair and scale-down all stop there. It is the
    same outage `blocking-pdb` reports and it hides better: the disruption
    controller picks one of the covering budgets per pod, arbitrarily, and only
    that one is woken by the pod's events, so it goes on reporting a healthy
    `status.disruptionsAllowed` while every eviction fails. The others freeze at
    whatever they last computed. Neither number answers the question, which is
    why the check counts budgets rather than reading either one's status.

    Anchored on workloads rather than on budgets, which decides two things.
    `normalize_workloads` has already applied S1-S5, so the system namespaces
    where GKE's own budgets overlap each other cost nothing and report nothing.
    And the object named is the workload, not either budget: which of the two
    should go is a judgement -- a chart's PDB beside a hand-written one, or one
    broad budget catching a workload it was never meant to cover -- and naming
    a budget would also make the finding id depend on which one sorted first,
    so a run where that order changed would read as one finding resolving and
    another appearing. 3.23 tells the model how to choose and §4 already
    permits a remediation to edit a manifest other than the object it names.

    S2 does *not* exclude a budget from the count. An addon-managed PDB
    overlapping a user's is the most likely way a real fleet reaches this
    state, and the eviction API does not care who wrote either one; suppressing
    the addon's half would hide the finding whose fix -- narrow the user's
    budget -- is the most clearly correct one there is. What S2 does is
    suppress the finding where *every* covering budget is addon-managed, since
    that is a drain block nobody can close, the reason 3.6 records.

    §3.11 asks whether a Deployment declares one replica. That is the right
    question for a workload whose replica count is a written-down number, and
    the wrong one for a workload whose replica count an HPA rewrites all day:
    `spec.replicas` in the dump is whatever the autoscaler happened to want at
    the moment the audit read it. An audit that fires at 06:50 UTC sees three
    replicas and says nothing; the rollout at 03:00 sees one and drops every
    request. The floor is the durable fact and the instantaneous count is not,
    so this check reads `minReplicas` and ignores `spec.replicas` entirely.

    The floor being one is also the case where the usual objection to §3.11's
    finding does not apply. There the answer is `manual` because going HA
    "touches leader election, session handling, and storage" -- true of a
    workload nobody has ever run two copies of. An HPA with `maxReplicas` above
    one is the owner's own written statement that a controller may run several
    copies concurrently with no human in the loop, so those three questions
    were settled before this check looked. Raising the *floor* asks strictly
    less of the workload than the ceiling it already carries, which is what
    makes this a one-line manifest change rather than guidance.

    The finding names the HPA and not the workload, so §4's declaration rule
    resolves the file the fix actually edits. Editing `spec.replicas` on the
    Deployment instead is the trap: the autoscaler writes that field, and a
    pull request setting it to two merges, reconciles, and is undone on the

    Endpoint removal and `SIGTERM` are two independent, concurrent reactions to
    a pod being deleted: the kubelet starts terminating the container while the
    endpoints controller is still propagating the removal out to every node's
    kube-proxy and to every Ingress or mesh sidecar holding a connection. The
    container almost always wins that race, so requests keep arriving at a
    process that has already begun shutting down and are answered with a
    connection reset. A `preStop` hook is the only thing in the pod lifecycle
    that delays `SIGTERM`, which is why the fix is a hook that sleeps rather
    than anything in the application.

    That makes this the one rollout defect nobody sees in a rolling update: the
    Deployment goes green, the new pods pass their probes, and the only trace
    is a burst of 502s in whatever sits in front. It costs errors on every
    deploy, every node drain, every autoscaler scale-down, and every
    preemption -- which on Spot capacity is continuous.

    Narrowed three ways, because unnarrowed this fires on essentially every
    workload in a fleet and a check that flags everything has told you nothing.
    `_SCOPE_SERVING` drops the workloads whose only Service is a metrics scrape
    endpoint -- Prometheus retries, so a reset there costs a gap in a graph
    rather than a user's request -- and the same qualifier is what
    `check_probes_readiness` and `check_single_replica` already use to avoid
    the same false claim. More than one replica, because a single-replica
    workload has a hard outage on every rollout whatever its hooks do, and
    `check_single_replica` is the finding that says so; adding a `preStop`
    sleep there delays the outage rather than removing it. And only the
    containers actually behind the Service's `targetPort`, for the reason
    `_containers_behind_a_service` gives: a log shipper with no hook is not in
    the request path and cannot reset anything.

    DaemonSets are in scope with no replica test. One pod per node is not the
    single-replica case -- the other nodes keep serving -- so a rolling update

    `preStop`, whatever it runs -- this check does not grade the hook's
    contents". That is the right scope for 3.13 and it leaves one shape
    unreported, the shape where the hook is present and does nothing.

    `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is the ceiling the whole termination runs
    inside, hook included. When the hook's wait reaches that ceiling the
    kubelet sends SIGKILL with the hook still sleeping, so the delay never
    happens and the container never even receives the SIGTERM the delay was
    protecting. The workload is in exactly the state 3.13 describes while

    says nothing at all.

    This is 3.13's own remediation getting written wrong, which is why it is
    worth a check rather than a sentence. That remediation already says to
    raise the grace period "above that wait if it is not already"; a check is
    what notices when someone did not, whether that someone was a previous run
    of this audit or the hundred blog posts that print `sleep 30` next to a
    grace period nobody mentioned.

    seconds -- see `_prestop_wait_seconds`. Reaching the ceiling is the
    predicate, not merely approaching it: at `wait == grace` the hook is
    provably truncated, while "the hook leaves too little room for the
    application to shut down" needs a number for how much room an application
    needs, which this audit cannot know.

    `>=` rather than `>` is also what keeps the native handler in scope at all.
    The apiserver validates `lifecycle.preStop.sleep.seconds` against the grace
    period and refuses anything larger -- measured on GKE 1.35, `seconds: 31`
    under a 30s ceiling is rejected outright and `seconds: 30` is accepted --
    so `wait == grace` is the only truncated native shape that can exist on a
    cluster. Tightening this to `>` would silently retire the native arm
    rather than narrow it. Nothing validates the shell spelling, which is why

    A `ReadWriteOnce` claim is attached by one **node** at a time -- not by one
    pod, which is what `ReadWriteOncePod` means and why the two modes both
    exist. Put two pods that can coexist behind one claim and the outcome is
    the scheduler's to decide: co-located they both mount it and nothing is
    wrong, separated the second sits in ContainerCreating with a
    `Multi-Attach error for volume` until something gives.

    That conditionality is the reason this is worth reporting rather than a
    reason not to. Nothing in the manifest decides which way it goes, so the
    workload's ability to be updated depends on free capacity on one
    particular node -- and the moments that capacity disappears are exactly
    the moments the rollout matters: the node filled up, or it was cordoned
    for an upgrade. A workload given a volume of its own is also usually sized
    so a second copy does not fit beside it in the first place. Measured on a
    GKE Autopilot cluster, a single-replica Deployment small enough to double
    up on its node rolled cleanly twice in a row; the finding on it is latent,
    and the fix is what keeps it latent.

    Two shapes reach the contended state and this check reports both, because
    they are the same cause and take different fixes.

    The first is a rollout. `RollingUpdate` -- the default, and the strategy of
    a Deployment that never mentions one -- creates the replacement before
    removing the original, so the two overlap by design. **When it does
    deadlock, the failure is silence.** No pod goes down, because the old one
    is not permitted to leave until the new one is ready and the new one never
    will be; the Deployment reports `Available` throughout, the rollout
    eventually records `ProgressDeadlineExceeded`, and the workload carries on
    serving the image it was already running. Every subsequent change is
    accepted by the API server and lands nowhere, which is how a workload with
    a fully reconciled GitOps repository behind it can sit on a year-old image.

    The second is a replica count. Above one replica the pods coexist by
    definition rather than during a rollout, and the scheduler spreads a
    ReplicaSet's pods across nodes by default -- so what does not co-locate
    stays pending, and what does co-locate has given up the redundancy the
    replica count was asking for.

    That first shape is very common and it is the one worth a check, because
    every other reading of the object says the workload is fine. It needs no
    unusual manifest: a Deployment, a claim, and the default strategy are
    enough, which describes most of the single-instance datastores and
    dashboards that get run as Deployments rather than StatefulSets.

    3.14 comes at `spec.strategy` from the opposite side and names this
    situation without being able to detect it -- its remediation says to
    "check first whether `Recreate` was chosen on purpose", because a workload
    holding a `ReadWriteOnce` volume needs it. This is the check that knows.
    The two cannot both fire on one object: 3.14 excludes single-replica
    Deployments, and this one recommends `Recreate` only there.

    Two spellings of the same outage. `strategy.type: Recreate` tells the
    Deployment controller to delete every existing pod and only then create the
    replacements, so a workload with three replicas serves nothing from the
    first deletion until the first new pod passes its readiness probe -- an
    image pull plus a cold start, tens of seconds at best and minutes for
    anything that warms a cache on boot. `RollingUpdate` with `maxUnavailable`
    at or above the replica count is the same thing written the long way: the
    controller is permitted to take all of them down in one step, and it does.

    This is worth its own check because it is invisible in every other reading
    of the object. The Deployment reports `Available` between rollouts, the
    replica count is whatever the author intended, the probes are correct, and
    there is no event to find afterwards -- the outage lasts only as long as
    the rollout and leaves nothing behind but errors in a client's logs. It
    surfaces only when someone reads `spec.strategy`, and until now nothing in
    this collector did except to suppress: `check_single_replica` returns
    `None` on `Recreate` (a single replica has an outage on any strategy, so
    naming the strategy there would be the wrong finding), and returns `None`
    again whenever `replicas != 1`. A `Recreate` Deployment with three replicas
    fell through both arms and was reported by nothing.

    Not a finding on a single replica, for that same reason, and not one on
    `maxUnavailable` merely being large: `maxUnavailable: 2` of 3 is a
    deliberate speed-over-capacity choice that still leaves a pod serving.
    Only reaching the replica count is unambiguous, because at that point the

    §2.4 and §2.5 both run every subject through `_is_non_system_subject`,
    which returns `False` for any `User` or `Group` whose name starts
    `system:`. That exclusion is load-bearing and correct for what it was
    written for: GKE ships dozens of `system:`-prefixed bootstrap bindings on
    every cluster, and reporting them was the flood §1 exists to avoid. What
    it also swallows is the three `system:` subjects that are not a component
    identity but a wildcard over callers -- `system:anonymous`,
    `system:unauthenticated`, and `system:authenticated`. So the single worst
    RBAC mistake anyone makes is the one shape those two checks are
    structurally unable to report, and it stays invisible however severe the
    role behind it is: a ClusterRoleBinding of `cluster-admin` to
    `system:anonymous` produces nothing from either.

    It is a mistake people make on purpose. `kubectl create clusterrolebinding
    <x> --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=system:anonymous` is the accepted
    answer to a dozen "my dashboard says forbidden" questions, and
    `--group=system:authenticated` is how a team gets `edit` without anyone
    writing down who is on it.

    The two arms are graded differently because they fail differently. For an
    anonymous subject any role at all is the finding, resolved or not: `view`
    bound to `system:anonymous` hands every ConfigMap and every pod spec in
    the cluster to whoever can reach the endpoint. For
    `system:authenticated` the role decides, and a read-only one is not
    reported at all -- `view` bound to that group is how a great many
    organisations make a cluster browsable, `_sa_groups_granted` already
    treats it as a legitimate posture rather than a defect, and a check that
    called it critical here would be arguing with the same file.

    The baseline exclusions differ by arm, because Kubernetes binds different
    roles to each. `_BASELINE_AUTHENTICATED_ROLES` is the four it binds to
    `system:authenticated` (or to the ServiceAccount groups) on every cluster;
    `_BASELINE_ANONYMOUS_ROLES` is the one it binds to
    `system:unauthenticated`. `system:discovery` and `system:basic-user` lost
    that subject in Kubernetes 1.14, so binding either to an anonymous subject
    is how anonymous discovery is re-enabled -- a choice someone made, and one
    this check reports.

    One candidate per binding, naming every universal subject it matched: the
    finding id is (check, cluster, namespace, object), and a hit per subject
    would hand `finish` two candidates with one identity. An anonymous subject
    sets the impact whenever one is present, since it is the wider grant.

    `system:serviceaccounts` is deliberately absent. It is universal in the
    same way, but it names workloads rather than people, the remediation is a
    different one, and §2.14 already reasons about it where it matters.

    §2.7 covers the `default` ServiceAccount and stops there, which was the
    right scope when it was written and is no longer where the shape lives. A
    chart that follows current practice creates a ServiceAccount of its own,
    so `serviceAccountName` is set and §2.7 goes quiet -- and then most charts
    bind that ServiceAccount to nothing, because the workload never calls the
    API server, and leave `automountServiceAccountToken` alone, because it
    defaults to on. The result is a credential in the container filesystem
    that exists for no reason, on a workload §2.7 by construction cannot see.

    The unbound test is what makes this safe to open a pull request against.
    "This workload does not use its token" is not readable from a manifest and
    a finding asserting it is one an owner can refute from memory, which is
    why §2.7's impact sentence deliberately does not claim it. "Nothing has
    granted this ServiceAccount anything" is a different statement: it is
    provable from the RBAC dump, and it means the API server gives the token
    nothing. It does not prove that nothing else reads the token: an external
    verifier that reviews it with its own identity -- Vault's `kubernetes`
    auth method, fed by the Vault Agent injector's sidecar -- needs no binding
    here. The injector announces itself on the pod template, so that case is
    skipped; any other such consumer is what the remediation's `risk` tells
    the reviewer to rule out.

    An explicit projected `serviceAccountToken` volume is unaffected by
    `automountServiceAccountToken` and is therefore not an exclusion: a
    workload federating to an external audience through its own declared
    volume keeps working across this fix (the Vault Agent sidecar reads the

    public endpoint is served; `privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateEndpoint` is
    the legacy inversion of it, and GKE keeps returning that block for
    compatibility with only the addresses filled in. Reading them as an `or`
    took the union of two readings of the same fact: a cluster that turned the
    public endpoint off the current way, and so carries no legacy
    `enablePrivateEndpoint: true`, was reported as reachable from the internet
    at `critical`. Prefer the current field wherever GKE returns it and fall
    back to the legacy one only when it does not.

    Authorized networks answers for the IP endpoint and for nothing else, so it
    suppresses that path rather than the whole finding. A cluster whose IP
    endpoint is allowlisted and whose DNS endpoint takes external traffic is
    still answering the internet, and returning nothing for it told the
    operator the opposite -- the one shape where this check's silence was a
    false negative rather than a pass.

    An allowlist that excepts Google Cloud's own external addresses does not
    suppress the IP endpoint either, and that is the shape the fleet's own
    remediation used to produce: `--enable-master-authorized-networks
    --master-authorized-networks=<CIDR>` leaves `gcpPublicCidrsAccessEnabled`
    on, so acting on this finding closed it while the endpoint still answered
    every VM on Google Cloud. See `_has_restrictive_authorized_networks`.

# model servers rather than one itself, so it holds no weights and belongs to
# the credential prong below instead; `nim` would match `nimlang/nim:2.0` under
# these anchors, and NVIDIA's NIM containers request a GPU anyway, so the
# accelerator prong already has them. `tei` is left off for the same reason
# `nim` is -- three letters, no distinctiveness -- while its full name is

# The third prong, and the only one that does not depend on recognising a name.
# An image allowlist is never finished, and the gap is not hypothetical: the
# `_EMPTY_SCOPE_REASON` comment further down names this stream's real exposure
# as a model server whose runtime nobody has listed, serving on CPU so no
# accelerator gives it away, reported as a clean cluster. A container holding
# `OPENAI_API_KEY` is talking to a model provider whatever its image is called.
#
# This is what puts a model gateway in scope, which the image prong deliberately
# will not do. That prong is right that a gateway holds no weights, and wrong
# about the consequence: of the six checks it opens, four cannot fire on a
# weightless workload at all -- 3.3 needs a CSI or PVC volume, 3.2 a
# `trust_remote_code` directive, 3.4 a `--model` flag or a plaintext artifact
# URL, 3.6 a floating tag. The two that remain are the two worth asking about a
# gateway, because a gateway is defined by holding provider credentials on
# behalf of everything behind it: whether its endpoint is public (3.1) and
# whether those credentials are literals (3.5). This fleet's `litellm` answers
# no to both -- ClusterIP, three `secretKeyRef`s -- which is a verdict the
# stream could not previously reach.
#
# Whole-name and named-provider only, which is stricter than §3.5's name rule
# below and deliberately so. Admitting a workload here subjects it to all six
# checks, including being asked whether its endpoint is a public *inference*
# endpoint; `(MODEL|REGISTRY|INFERENCE).*KEY` is a fair heuristic once a
# workload is known to serve models and a bad one for deciding that it does.
# §3.5 unions the two, so a provider named only here is still read for a
# plaintext value.
#
# `envFrom` is deliberately not read. The credential's name lives in the Secret
# rather than in the pod spec, so all a pod spec can say is "this container has
# some envFrom" -- true on this fleet of `ip-masq-agent` on five clusters and of

    A check that reads `--model` out of a manifest is claiming some argument
    parser will act on it, and `command:` is what decides whether one ever sees
    it. Three shapes, and only the third differs from the flat token list:

    * **No `command:`** -- the image's own ENTRYPOINT is the model server and
      `args` are the flags it parses. Every workload that runs its image the way
      the publisher shipped it, including this fleet's `ai-embeddings-tei`.
    * **A `command:` naming a program** -- `["python3", "-m", "vllm.entrypoints.
      openai.api_server"]`, `["text-generation-launcher"]`. The program parses the
      rest, so the whole argv counts.
    * **A `command:` invoking inline code** -- everything after the code string is
      a positional argument to that inline program (`$0`, `$1`, `sys.argv[1:]`),
      not a flag. Under `sh -c` the code string *is* a command line, so its words
      are what a parser sees and are returned in place of the positionals -- which
      also finds the `--model` in `sh -c "vllm serve --model foo"` that a
      token-prefix match cannot see, because no single token starts with it. Under
      `python -c` or `node -e` the code string is source in another language and
      nothing here parses flags at all, so this returns nothing.

    That last case is not hypothetical. On 2026-09-06 this fleet published
    `CronJob/ai-batch-finetune` as a `major` 3.4 finding reading `--model
    meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with no --revision`, against a container whose
    entrypoint is `python3 -c "print('fixture; never scheduled')"`. The flag lands
    in `sys.argv` beside a print statement, no model is fetched at any point, the
    published impact ("the bytes that arrive at the next pod restart are whatever
    the source serves then") describes something that cannot happen, and the
    prescribed fix -- add `--revision <sha>` beside it -- changes nothing.

    3.2 deliberately does not use this. Its predicate is the textual presence of a
    trust directive anywhere the container carries one, and `trust_remote_code=True`
    written inside a `python -c` one-liner is a real instruction to the loader, not
    an inert flag. Different claim, different token set -- so this returns both.

    A `type: LoadBalancer` Service is an instruction to GCP to put a public
    address and a forwarding rule in front of some pods, and GKE carries it out
    without asking what is behind them. Point one at a database and the database
    is on the internet -- reachable by anyone who scans the address space, which
    for a Postgres or Redis port is a matter of hours. Nothing in Kubernetes
    objects to it. The Service admits, the load balancer provisions, the
    `EXTERNAL-IP` column fills in, and every check anyone would think to run says
    the Service is healthy, because it is: it is doing exactly what the manifest
    asked.

    It is one field that does it, and usually a copied one. A Service written
    `type: ClusterIP` for local development, promoted with `type: LoadBalancer`
    to reach it from a laptop, and merged. A Helm chart whose `service.type` is
    set in the values file used for every environment. A datastore moved out of
    `kube-system` into its own namespace with the Service carried across intact.

    Scoped by port, and that is what makes the finding decidable. §3.1's
    `inference-endpoint-public` flags any world-reachable model endpoint and is
    always `manual`, because the range of callers a model server is supposed to
    serve is a fact about intended usage this audit cannot read. Here there is
    no such range: nothing legitimately reaches a cluster's Redis, etcd or
    kubelet port from the open internet, so the fix does not depend on knowing
    who the caller was meant to be, and a pull request can carry it.

    Deliberately not the web ports, which is the one exclusion that keeps this
    check usable -- see `_WORLD_OPEN_LB_PORTS`.

    Three conditions beyond the port, each of which would otherwise produce a
    finding on something that is not exposed:

    - An internal load balancer is not on the internet whatever ports it
      publishes, and both annotation spellings say so.
    - `spec.loadBalancerSourceRanges` is enforcement, not intent: GKE programs it
      into the firewall in front of the forwarding rule. A Service that restricts
      to real CIDRs is bounded rather than open. `_restricting_source_ranges`
      already reads a `0.0.0.0/0` entry as no restriction at all.
    - `status.loadBalancer` records the address that was actually handed out. A
      Service whose every assigned address is private -- an internal balancer
      configured some other way, or a cluster whose provider ignores the type --
      is not reachable from the internet, so calling it exposed is just wrong.
      No address yet means the balancer is still provisioning, and the spec is
      all there is.

    UDP is excluded because none of these ports are UDP services; a UDP 27017 is
    not MongoDB, and flagging it would be flagging the number rather than the
    thing.

    The address is never published. This finding is filed as a comment on a
    public GitHub issue, and the whole content of the vulnerability is where to
    connect -- the port names what it is, the count carries the scale, and
    neither hands a reader the target. `adopt_collector_evidence` overwrites the
    model's excerpt with this string, so it is the excerpt that ships.

    covers the half where some finding's fix edits the stalled object's file.
    This covers the rest, which is most of it: nothing in the ledger has to
    point at an object for it to be wedged.

    Twice in two days on this fleet, and neither showed up anywhere a person
    was looking. On 2026-09-05 a `PubSubTopic` failed on a missing
    `roles/pubsub.editor` and took fifteen `ContainerCluster`s down with it. On
    2026-09-06 two `ComputeFirewall`s -- the merged remediation for a
    `firewall-world-open-ingress` critical -- retried a 403 every two minutes
    from 17:33 to 19:41 because the controller's service account had
    `compute.networkAdmin`, which grants the firewall read, and not
    `compute.securityAdmin`, which is where `compute.firewalls.update` lives.
    The rules stayed open to `0.0.0.0/0` on tcp:22 and tcp:3389 across fourteen
    nodes holding an external IP for four hours after the fix merged. Nothing
    crash-loops, no event lands outside the object, and the audit went on
    republishing the finding with no way to say why it was not clearing.

    One hit per *cause*. An object reporting `DependencyNotReady` is fine in
    itself and waiting on another object, so emitting one finding each would
    have turned that first incident into sixteen findings with one fix -- the
    flood this skill's `60k` body budget then spends on symptoms instead of
    causes. They are counted onto every cause's excerpt instead. The exception
    is a cluster where *every* unready object is a dependent: the cause is then
    not a Config Connector object at all (an external reference, or one deleted
    out from under its dependents), there is nothing else to name, and a
    `minor` hit each is the only way the reader hears about it.

    A dependent is only ever `DependencyNotReady`. `DependencyNotFound` reads
    like its neighbour and means the opposite thing for this check: the
    referent does not exist, so no other object here is going to be repaired
    into clearing it, and the object naming the missing reference *is* the
    cause. It stays a cause, and folding it in with the symptoms would drop the

# installed rather than with how many objects exist. Measured from the agent
# pod against an idle hub holding 19 objects: 10-14 seconds.

# That fits inside 60 comfortably, which is why the check looked fine until it
# ran for real. The collector sweeps `MAX_WORKERS` clusters at once, and the
# fifteen without Config Connector answer this read in about a tenth of a
# second, so the hub is the only one that is still working when the other seven
# in its wave are hammering the same pod -- and on 2026-09-06, the first day
# the check was live, it went past 60 and was recorded as inapplicable. The
# check has never once executed against the only cluster it can apply to.
#
# 240 is four times the default and roughly twenty times the idle read. It is

# fast, so the worst case adds minutes to a sweep that already runs for half an

# -- an agent that copies `commands` verbatim into `checks_run` (§2's
# instruction for every other check) and *also* follows §1's instruction to
# record these in `checks_not_applicable` would name the same slug in both
# lists, which the validator rejects.
#
# Each reason is scoped two ways on purpose, because the earlier wording
# ("privileged containers are rejected at admission and cannot exist here")
# was false on both counts. Privileged containers, host namespaces and
# hostPath mounts all run on this fleet's Autopilot clusters today -- they
# are Google's own system add-ons in kube-system, which S1 and S3 suppress,
# so "in-scope workloads" rather than a claim about the cluster. And
# admission rejecting them is a policy a WorkloadAllowlist can lift
# (`autogke-disallow-privilege`, `autogke-no-write-mode-hostpath`, GKE >=
# 1.32.0-gke.1000000), so the trailing clause is a fact the collector reads
# for -- see `autopilot_allowlists` -- rather than one it assumes.

# `ai-security-audit` is deliberately absent, and the omission is the whole

# above is *what the empty set is empty of*. Obtainability and compliance drop
# workloads that exist and could carry the defect -- a system namespace, an
# addon, an owned Pod, one scaled to zero -- so "no finding" there is an
# unexamined absence and the reason says so. ai-security's filter is the
# subject definition itself: with no AI workload on the cluster there is no
# object a public inference endpoint or a writable weights mount could be true
# of. "Six checks ran and matched nothing" is a verdict about the cluster, not
# a gap in the audit, and §1 of the SOP says the same in the instruction it
# calls the most important in that section.
#
# An earlier version of this comment argued the omission mechanically instead,
# and every step of it was wrong: it claimed all six checks take an AI workload
# so an empty scope leaves `commands` empty, forcing a `limitations` note and
# pinning the stream `partial` forever. `inference-endpoint-public` is
# `"cluster"`-kind, so `commands` keeps an entry and `checks_run` is never
# empty; the arm below writes `checks_not_applicable`, which is not
# `limitations`; and `checks_not_applicable` leaves the coverage denominator
# without producing a gap, so it could not
# make a run `partial` even if it did fire. Do not re-derive the omission from
# that chain -- it does not hold, and the argument above does not need it.
#
# The real exposure is upstream, in `_is_ai_workload`: a model server under an
# image name `AI_MODEL_IMAGE_RE` does not list, serving on CPU so no
# accelerator limit gives it away, is invisible to this stream and reported as
# a clean cluster. That is a discriminator false negative, not a bookkeeping
# one, and no entry in this table would catch it.
#
# `AI_PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_ENV_RE` is the answer to part of that, and only part.
# It admits a workload on a mark no allowlist has to keep up with -- holding a
# named provider credential -- which covers the unlisted runtime that pulls from
# Hugging Face or calls a hosted provider, and put this fleet's `litellm` in
# scope for the first time. What it still cannot see is a model server that
# neither matches a listed image nor holds a credential: one serving weights
# baked into its own image, on CPU, anonymously. Judge a "clean cluster" verdict
# from this stream against that shape before believing it.

    """Index the Kubernetes objects a GitOps clone declares, by cluster tree.

    Maps `(cluster, kind, namespace, metadata.name)` to the set of
    clone-relative paths declaring it — a set, because two files claiming one
    object is the ambiguity `declaration_for` refuses to resolve rather than
    guessing between.

    This is `audit_report.kcc_declarations` for workload objects, and it exists
    for the reason that one gives: "parsed rather than grepped, deliberately".
    Config Connector resources got that treatment; the Kubernetes objects every
    other stream flags did not, and their SOPs still tell the *model* to run
    `grep -rl "name: <object>"` once per finding and decide for itself. It does
    not decide consistently. On 2026-09-06 the live fleet carried 116 findings
    in which `Deployment/waste-unsized` was `kind: manifest` with a correct
    path under `unsized-workload` and `kind: manual` -- "no pull request is
    possible" -- under `probes-liveness`, `no-requests` and `no-memory-limit`,
    which are the same object in the same file. Fourteen findings were `manual`
    on objects this index resolves.

    Config Connector resources are skipped, not overlooked: `kcc_declarations`
    already indexes them, keyed by the GCP resource name that `spec.resourceID`
    can override, and a `Cluster/<name>` finding must keep resolving through
    that table rather than through this one.

    Returns `{}` when PyYAML is absent or the clone is unreadable, which leaves

    The companion `workload_declarations` above resolves a workload to the file
    declaring *that object*. A workload a chart renders has no such file: the
    repo declares the release, and the object exists only after Helm expands
    the chart. That is the single largest reason a finding cannot open a pull
    request. Of the 53 findings in the 2026-09-07 obtainability run, 48 were
    `manual`, and the reason most of them gave was that the workload "is not
    declared in this repository" -- true of Argo CD's own Deployments, of
    cert-manager, and of the kube-agents chart's `litellm`. It is true of most
    workloads in most real fleets, because most real fleets install charts.
    A Kustomize overlay over a base in another repository leaves the object
    equally undeclared, and is resolved here for the same reason.

    Maps a key to a record naming the declaration and what it renders. Two key
    shapes, because the reconcilers mark their objects differently and
    `release_of` reads both:

    - `(cluster, RELEASE_KEY_APPLICATION, application_name)` -- an Argo CD
      `Application`, sourcing either a chart or a Kustomize overlay, found
      from a tracking id.
    - `(cluster, RELEASE_KEY_RELEASE, release_namespace, release_name)` -- a
      Flux `HelmRelease`, or that same Argo CD Application under the release
      coordinates it installs, found from the `meta.helm.sh` annotation pair.
      Helm only: Kustomize output carries no such annotation.

    Each record carries a `renderer` of `RENDERER_HELM` or `RENDERER_KUSTOMIZE`
    saying how `values_field` is written -- a values mapping the chart reads by
    key, or a list of patches Kustomize applies to a matched object.

    Resolving the cluster is the part that differs from `workload_declarations`,
    which reads it off the path. An Argo CD Application names its own
    destination and may live anywhere in the repo -- `bootstrap/`, `apps/`, a
    flat root -- so the path convention would miss it entirely. Where the
    destination is a `server` URL rather than a `name`, the Argo cluster
    registration Secrets carry the mapping, and a first pass builds it.
    A `HelmRelease` names no cluster at all, Flux being per-cluster, so that
    one does fall back to the `clusters/<name>/` convention.

    `ApplicationSet` is deliberately not indexed. Its generated Applications
    have templated names and destinations this cannot evaluate without
    reimplementing the generators, and guessing which cluster a generated
    Application lands on is exactly the cluster-blind failure mode
    `declaration_for` refuses. A fleet installing charts through an
    ApplicationSet keeps the `manual` verdict it has today.

    """Where a *new* object for one cluster's namespace belongs in the clone.

    The two indexes above both answer "where is this object declared", and a
    finding whose fix is an edit needs nothing more. A finding whose fix is a
    new object needs the other question answered — `netpol-missing` writes a
    NetworkPolicy that does not exist yet, `default-sa-automount` a
    ServiceAccount — and neither index answers it, because the object they
    would look up is the one that is missing.

    So the model is left to decide, and its reasoning is wrong in a way that
    reads as careful. From the 2026-09-07 obtainability run, on a namespace
    this function resolves: "No file in this repository declares an applied
    object in namespace podinfo-kustomize -- only the ArgoCD Application
    sources that install a chart/overlay into it, which is not a sibling under
    SOP section 3's rule." Every clause of that is true and the conclusion is
    false. `clusters/spot-capacity-test/kustomize/podinfo/` is a Kustomize root
    *in this repository* that the Application renders into that namespace;
    `_argocd_kustomize_source` proved it is one, against the clone, before the
    finding was written. The collector knew and the model did not.

    Two shapes, in precedence order:

    - `NAMESPACE_DIRECTORY_SIBLING` — the one directory holding declarations
      already applied to that cluster and namespace. This is the SOP's own
      sibling rule, computed from the parsed index rather than grepped, and it
      wins where both apply: a directory of plain manifests is applied as it
      stands, so a file added to it needs no wiring at all.
    - `NAMESPACE_DIRECTORY_OVERLAY` — the local Kustomize root an Argo CD
      Application renders into the namespace. A file added here renders only
      once the `resources:` list names it, which a one-file remediation cannot
      also add, so the SOPs make such a fix `kind: manual`.
    - `NAMESPACE_DIRECTORY_CLUSTER` — the one directory in the clone declaring
      objects applied to that *cluster*, whatever their namespace, stored under
      `NAMESPACE_KEY_ANY` for the caller to fall back to. This is the arm with
      the yield, and the reason is that the namespaces a finding lands in are
      mostly not ones the repo declares into: on 2026-09-07 the manual findings
      here sat in `argocd`, `cert-manager` and `kubeagents-system`, none of
      which any file names, while the cluster each of them runs on has a
      directory Argo CD applies wholesale. A NetworkPolicy for `cert-manager`
      goes there — that is where a NetworkPolicy for someone else's chart
      belongs anyway, rather than in a fork of the chart.

      Two things have to hold, and both are checked rather than assumed. The
      directory has to be unambiguous, as in the other arms. And no AppProject
      may whitelist namespaces, since that is what turns "applied to the
      cluster" into "applied to these namespaces on it"; see
      `_projects_restrict_namespaces`, which is deliberately blunt about it. A
      remediation using this arm has to set `metadata.namespace` explicitly:
      the Application's own destination namespace, where it has one, is only
      the default for objects that declare none.

      Unambiguous is counted over the directories objects are applied *from*,
      which is not every directory holding a manifest: a Kustomize root is
      indexed like any other and renders only what its kustomization lists, so
      counting it makes a cluster ambiguous that has exactly one plain-apply
      tree. That was not hypothetical either. On 2026-09-07 the clone held five
      such directories across four clusters and this arm resolved three of
      them; the cluster it skipped was `spot-capacity-test`, whose second
      directory is the `clusters/spot-capacity-test/kustomize/podinfo` overlay
      that the merged `no-pdb` remediation had just added. `_kustomize_roots`
      is the exclusion, and it takes the root's subdirectories with it, since a
      manifest one level down inside an overlay is no more applied as it stands
      than one at the top.

    Two directories declaring into one namespace is the ambiguity
    `declaration_for` refuses, and is refused here for the same reason: naming
    one would name the wrong one about half the time. Absent means unresolved,
    never "nowhere" — the SOP's grep is still the answer then.

    Nothing resolves from a mirror carrying MIRROR_RELEASES_WITHHELD_MARKER.
    Every arm leans on what that marker withholds: `_kustomize_roots` reads the
    release index, and without it a directory inside an overlay reads as a
    plain `sibling`, which is the never-rendering pull request above; and the
    missing file may be the AppProject that withdraws the `cluster` arm.
    Nor does anything for a cluster MIRROR_CLUSTERS_WITHHELD_MARKER names: its
    tree left the mirror, so the sibling arm that would have won there cannot,
    and an overlay elsewhere would answer in its place.

    Content mode's counterpart of the clone `workload_declarations`,
    `release_declarations` and `namespace_directories` walk. Without it, a
    content-mode run hands them an empty scratch directory and no candidate
    carries `declaration` or `namespace_directory`, so the model falls back to
    its own search and a fix the collector could have placed becomes
    `kind: manual`.

    `dest` is a private temporary directory, never the remediation workspace:
    `finish` publishes every file in that, and a mirrored manifest written there
    would be proposed as a fix.

    Every region it indexes is whole. A region missing files would index an
    object declared twice as declared once, and `declaration_for` would then
    name one of the two files instead of refusing -- a wrong path, which is
    worse than the absent one the SOPs already handle. So a capped listing,
    an unknown skip, any broker failure, or a failed write returns False, the
    caller does not index `dest`, and the run proceeds as it did before this
    existed.

    One file the broker will never send -- over its per-file limit
    (`tooLarge`), or a symlink, which `read` refuses and `list` names apart
    from its entries -- withholds only what it could have declared into. A
    file under `clusters/<c>/` drops that cluster's whole tree from the
    mirror, because `workload_declarations` keys by that path. Any withheld
    file that could hold a release, wherever it sits, leaves
    MIRROR_RELEASES_WITHHELD_MARKER, because an Argo CD Application can live
    anywhere and target any cluster: no candidate then carries
    `release_declaration` or `namespace_directory`. A symlink and a
    Kustomization file always could; a `tooLarge` file could unless the
    broker's search reads it, finds none of the kinds the release index reads,
    and finds a column-0 `kind` (`_may_declare_release`), and the rest of its
    cluster's tree (a Kustomization only where an Application names its
    directory, `_application_source_paths`), which
    goes with it, holds none either. The other clusters keep their `declaration`, and
    each withheld file is logged with what it cost.

    A link to a directory, which `list` names with its target, is recreated
    in the mirror (`_mirror_directory_link`); one whose target the mirror
    cannot hold leaves the marker instead.
