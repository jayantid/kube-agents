"""fleet_waste.py — Procedural collector for the Fleet Waste Audit
(`fleet-wide-cost-analysis`).

Its manifest is the contract in docs/designs/fleet-audit-collector-manifest.md,
which `audit_report.py finish --manifest-file` cross-checks the published
document against; the checks it runs are defined in
governance/fleet_wide_cost_analysis_sop.md.

This stream's own collector: its targets are both GKE clusters (the fifteen
`kubectl` object kinds in `CLUSTER_DUMP_KINDS`, a Cloud
Monitoring usage read, `gcloud container node-pools list`, and §3.7's
`gcloud container operations list` for `CREATE_NODE_POOL`, which dates each
pool; a pool with no such operation is dated from the cluster's `createTime`,
and only a failed operations read falls back to node age, with a limitation)
and GCP projects
(`gcloud compute disks/addresses/forwarding-rules/target-pools/backend-services`
and `gcloud artifacts repositories list`),
so its manifest mixes cluster-named entries with `project/<id>` entries the
same way `networking_audit.py` does (§3's "project-scoped GCP objects" rule).

§1 scopes this to "every project the agent can see", so a bare invocation
reads the active project plus every listed project, whether or not it holds a
cluster -- a project whose last cluster was deleted is where its disks and
addresses are left behind -- rather than auditing only the active gcloud
project; `--project` overrides discovery for a scoped run. Each project's
cluster listing runs in a pool before the clusters are read, and its disk,
address, load-balancer and registry reads share the cluster pool; neither is
started after `PROJECT_READ_DEADLINE_S`, so the run aims to end inside its
terminal timeout with a manifest. Project-scoped facts (live PV handles, Service
names, referenced addresses) are unioned only across the clusters in the
same project before that project's disk/address/LB checks run — a project
never sees another project's cluster state.

**Usage comes from Cloud Monitoring, not from sampling.** §2 used to require
three `kubectl top` reads five minutes apart per cluster, and the ten minutes
of wall clock that bought was the smaller of its two costs. The larger one was
what a ten-minute Monday-morning window cannot see: a nightly batch peak, a
weekday traffic curve, anything that makes a workload look idle at the moment
you happen to look at it. Every caveat §2 carried — require all three samples
to agree, take the peak and never the mean, keep an absolute floor, never
propose a request below 2x the observed peak — was scaffolding around that
blind spot.

GKE already ships per-container CPU and memory to Cloud Monitoring on every
cluster, retained for weeks. `fetch_usage_peaks` asks it for the peak over the
trailing `USAGE_WINDOW_HOURS` instead, which is both faster (a handful of HTTP
reads per cluster, no sleeping at all) and strictly better evidence: a week-long
peak has already seen the batch job the sample window missed. It reads through
the credential broker's read-only Cloud API relay
(`docs/designs/gcp-api-relay.md`), so no token is ever materialized in the
sandbox, and `roles/monitoring.viewer` on the broker's identity is the only
grant it needs.

# It was 2 vCPU / 4 GiB, which is a node's worth of headroom inside a single
# controller, and on a fleet of ordinarily-sized services nothing ever reaches
# it: measured against the sixteen-cluster adamparco-kage fleet on 2026-09-05,
# seven controllers were under 20% of their requests on both dimensions --
# including two `ai-inference` Deployments requesting 0.5 vCPU / 2 GiB each and
# peaking at 0.001 vCPU / 0.15 GiB over a week -- and the floor dropped every
# one of them. The stream published a single finding, for an unused IP address,
# and an operator reading it would conclude the fleet had no rightsizing work.
#
# Lowering it to 250m / 512Mi fixed those two and left the shape of the bug in
# place, because the quantity was wrong as well as the number. The floor was
# compared against the reclaimable delta while its justification -- "about the
# smallest request a first-class service is given" -- describes a request, and
# the two coincide only where usage is near zero. So the clusters it kept
# silencing were the ones whose requests sit at or just under the floor and
# which are ~100% idle: on the same fleet, `github-token-minter` requests 200m
# and 256Mi, peaked at 0.001 vCPU and 24 MiB over a week -- half a percent of
# its CPU request -- and was dropped for a 199m delta, and `litellm` was
# dropped for a 176m one at 12% of its CPU request. Eight controllers in all.
# Comparing the request instead makes the sentence above true of what the code
# does, and drops the 20% of slack that made a 200m request fail a 250m test.
#
# 100m / 128Mi is an order of magnitude above the sidecar the floor is aimed at
# while admitting the ordinary small service. It excludes what it was written
# for on the live fleet -- `cert-manager` and its webhook at 10m/32Mi, both
# ~99% idle and both unshrinkable in any way worth an engineer's attention --
# and admits every controller above that. Severity is unchanged, so the
# newly-reachable findings arrive as `minor` and a node's worth of waste still
# grades `major`.

# worth reporting; these decide what the new request would be.
#
# A controller already sitting at this floor on every dimension the excerpt calls
# idle has a recommendation identical to the request it already declares, so the

# `idle-workload` takes the population the two floors above drop between them:
# a controller whose resize is a no-op on every dimension it declares. The
# comment on the resize floors is right that no manifest edit closes such a
# finding, and wrong that there is therefore nothing to say. A workload sitting
# at the smallest request the platform will admit, using a twentieth of it for
# a month, is not mis-sized -- it is unused, and the edit that reclaims it is
# deleting the file, which is a pull request the resize never was.
#
# The same bar as `check_overrequest`, on purpose. What separates the two
# checks is not how idle a workload is but whether anything can be done about
# it: 3.1 takes the shrinkable ones, this takes the rest. A second, stricter
# threshold here would be a number to defend with nothing deciding on it, and
# the first attempt at one -- 5%, read off a report that quoted peaks rather
# than ratios -- excluded all four workloads the check exists to find. Their
# memory sits at 6.6% to 14.7% of a 64Mi request, because 64Mi is the floor
# and a process that does nothing still maps a few MiB of libc.
#
# 3.1 applies it per dimension; this applies it to every dimension the
# controller declares, which is what makes the finding "nobody is using this"
# rather than "one dimension is oversized". On the live fleet that distinction
# is what excludes `cert-manager` (17% CPU but 95% memory), its webhook (7%

# A ratio test alone would flag every pod a megabyte over its request.
#
# 128 MiB is where the two live examples separate. On the sixteen-cluster
# adamparco-kage fleet on 2026-09-05, exactly three pods held a mean above their

# for a ~980 MiB overage across the controller, and `cert-manager-cainjector`,
# requesting 32Mi and averaging 65Mi. The cainjector is genuinely mis-sized and

    `--skip-nodes-with-local-storage` pins one carrying an `emptyDir` or

    tested here is the mirror pod, which that index keeps.

    Two more rules pin a node whatever the namespace: a pod annotated

    §3.8 reports the workload half of this as findings of its own and skips

    `USAGE_WINDOW_HOURS` is what the Monitoring read asks for. What bounds the

    of those bounds because there are two pod populations.

    Without `replaced`, the series in hand are the live pods' names, and for
    most kinds that is the live pods' history: the bound is the longest-lived
    one's age and a finding may not claim more. A kind in
    `SAME_NAME_RECREATION_KINDS` is the exception. A StatefulSet recreates
    `db-0` as `db-0`, and the read groups by pod name, so the live name's
    series already holds every earlier incarnation and the bound is the
    controller's age, as it is with `replaced`. The read collapses each series
    to one point, so when that history starts is not in the answer; the
    controller's creation is the bound it cannot exceed.

    With `replaced`, `_observed_pod_keys` found series from pods this controller
    has since rolled away, so the read reaches back past every live pod -- as
    far as the controller itself, which is where this clamps instead. The
    distinction is not cosmetic: on 2026-09-06 nine of the twenty-two cost
    findings claimed a 6h window because Argo CD's pods had rolled that morning,
    while the controllers were weeks old and the earlier pods' series were
    sitting unread in the same response.

    Both numbers reach the reader, from different directions, and until this
    existed neither said anything about the other. `evidence.command` records
    the read verbatim and so carries `window=168h`; the excerpt carried "over
    the trailing 12h". The 2026-09-06 cost report published three findings that
    way -- a reader checking the evidence had the query in one hand, a different
    number in the other, and no way to reconcile them but to guess which was

    pull request somebody can merge.

    The partition with §3.1 is exact and load-bearing, and it turns on whether
    §3.1 *will* propose a resize rather than on whether one is arithmetically
    available. Usually those are the same thing and this fires only where
    `_resize_shrinks_request` is false on every declared dimension, or true
    only on one whose request is under §3.1's materiality floor. The
    exception is a `Guaranteed` controller, where §3.1 declines the resize it
    could compute, because on such a pod the request is also the limit;
    `_stands_down_instead_of_resizing` carries that argument and §3.1 skips
    exactly what this admits. Either way no controller produces both findings,
    so the report never asks a reader to both shrink and stand down one object.
