class TestFinishWithoutAManifestIsUnchanged(HarnessTestCase):
    """`finish` without `--manifest-file` is, byte for byte, what it was before
    the collector contract landed.

    The contract is meant to be inert until a stream passes a manifest, and
    "inert" is a claim about every byte the run emits rather than about a
    payload key or two: the `gh` argv sequence, the bodies each call carried,
    the JSON line on stdout and the log on stderr. Each scenario below records
    all of that against a frozen clock and compares it with a transcript
    captured from the harness *before* the contract was added. A key added
    unconditionally to the payload, a log line that now prints on every run,
    a renderer that reorders a section -- each fails here, naming the byte.

    One deviation is deliberate and is recorded in the transcripts rather than
    excused: `ID_SCHEME` went from 2 to 3 when the drift collector began
    qualifying cluster names, from 3 to 4 when the patch-readiness
    collector did the same, from 4 to 5 when `collect.py` did it for three
    more streams, and from 5 to 6 when `fleet_waste.py` and `fleet_stockout.py`
    did it for cost and stockout, and the stamp is global, so every stream's bodies
    carry the current number. That is the whole of the change here -- five
    lines, one per body -- and this class is what proves it. The compliance
    roster growing from eleven checks to sixteen is recorded the same way: the
    Scope table's `n/n` column and the unrun-check prose count the roster.
    The report store is the other: the previous body is read from the store
    rather than from `gh issue view --json body`, so that one call is gone
    from every transcript that had an open ledger, and the `gh issue list`
    that finds the ledger asks for `number,url,body` rather than
    `number,url`, the body being what the store's record is checked against
    and, where the store never held the ledger, what seeds it. One line of
    output moved with it: the clean-over-a-gap run's stderr says the gaps mean
    it "cannot vouch for the ledger's state", where it said it "cannot speak
    for the fleet", because a lost store record also makes a clean run
    partial, and the line now covers both causes. Nothing else moved.

    Five scenarios, chosen to pass through every branch a manifest could
    touch: the findings path with a delta and an auto-promoted pull request,
    the clean path that closes the ledger, the clean path held over a previous
    finding the document did not account for, the clean-over-a-gap path that
    leaves the ledger open, and the dry run that renders both bodies to stdout.
