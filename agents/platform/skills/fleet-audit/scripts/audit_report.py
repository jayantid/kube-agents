audit_report.py — Deterministic reporting harness for the fleet-audit skill.

Every autonomous audit watchdog (compliance, security patch, obtainability,
cost, consistency drift, AI workload security) funnels its findings through
this script. Each audit
stream owns exactly ONE open GitHub **issue** — its ledger — rewritten in place
on every run and closed as completed when the fleet comes back clean. Fixes
travel separately, as narrow remediation pull requests carrying only the files
that fix a specific group of findings, so a report is never a pull request with
no diff. The LLM's role is strictly constrained to **inspecting the fleet
read-only and emitting a findings.json**; every git or forge operation, every
rendered body, the commit subjects, the timestamps, and the run-over-run delta are
produced here, deterministically.

Two-command lifecycle, plus three on-demand commands:

    audit_report.py start     --audit <audit-id>
    audit_report.py finish    --audit <audit-id> --findings-file <path> [--dry-run]
                          [--manifest-file <path> | --no-collector-manifest <why>]
                          [--decline-fix <id> <why> ...]
    audit_report.py remediate --audit <audit-id> --findings-file <path>
                          --finding <id> [--finding <id>...] [--dry-run]
    audit_report.py fetch     --audit <audit-id> --path <repo-path> [--path ...]
    audit_report.py list      --audit <audit-id> [--prefix <repo-path>]

There are two ways a fix reaches GitHub, and which one runs depends on whether
the broker has content workspaces armed.

**Content mode.** The workspace `start` hands over is a plain directory. The
agent writes its remediation manifests into it, and `finish` reads the bytes and
hands them to the broker, which owns the only checkout. Nothing here ever sees a
`.git`, so nothing here can author the `.git/config` that every known
code-execution route through the credential container needs — a filter driver,
an alias, a hook path. `list` and `fetch` are the read half — the names of the
files in the broker's checkout, and the bytes of the ones a fix has to start
from.

**Directory mode** is what ran before: a leased clone on the shared volume, and
`checkout`, `add`, `commit`, `push` run in it. The sandbox's `git` has no network
transport and no credential, so it cannot run there any more. It is taken only
when no broker is configured at all (`CREDENTIAL_PROXY_URL` unset), and with a
broker configured a probe that does not answer yes refuses `start` rather than
fall back to it.

`start` reports which one it took as the `mode` field of its JSON line, and the
mode is resolved once per process so a single run cannot take both forks.

The pure functions (validate/render/delta) carry no I/O and are unit tested in
test_audit_report.py; the thin shell below them owns all subprocess execution.

    """What a stream is called, which SOP defines it, and every check in it.

    `checks` is the roster: the backticked slug in each `####` check heading of
    the stream's SOP, in SOP order. It exists so the harness can tell an audit
    that *ran* from one that merely *finished*. Without it, "I evaluated eleven
    checks against three clusters and found nothing" and "I read the first page
    of the SOP, enumerated the fleet, and stopped" produce byte-identical
    documents — both a populated `scope.clusters` and an empty `findings`, both
    published as a confident all-clear. That is not hypothetical: it is how five
    streams reported a clean fleet on a fleet that was not.

    `sop` is the filename under `agents/platform/governance/`. The validator
    names it when it rejects a slug, because the roster itself must never appear
    in an error message — see `_reject_unknown_check`.

    `test_check_rosters_match_the_sops` re-derives `checks` from the SOP
    headings, so a check added to an SOP without being added here fails CI
    rather than becoming a check no run is ever required to perform.

    `derived` names slugs a finding may cite but no cluster is ever asked to
    run. They are the streams' meta-findings — a conclusion drawn *across*
    facets rather than a check performed against one — so they belong in the
    set a `finding.check` is validated against but not in the coverage
    denominator, where they would read as a check nobody performed and hold the
    ledger open forever. `fleet-consistency-drift`'s split-cluster guard is the
    standing example: it fires when a cluster is an outlier on six or more
    facets, which is not something you can run against a cluster in isolation.

    `scopes` partitions the roster by the *kind* of target a check runs against,
    for a stream whose SOP enumerates more than clusters: a `project/<id>` entry
    carries the checks that read project-level GCP objects, and a networking
    stream can give every subnet its own entry. Without the partition the
    denominator is the whole roster for every target, so a project entry is
    charged with the cluster checks it was never meant to run and each cluster
    with the project ones, and the stream reads `partial` forever on the
    strength of it. A slug may appear under two kinds when the SOP defines a
    form of the check for each. Empty measures every target against the whole
    roster, which is what every stream does until its SOP declares otherwise;
    `test_scopes_partition_the_roster` asserts the union across kinds is exactly
    `checks`, so a check cannot land on a partitioned roster without an owning
    kind — it would otherwise be a check the harness silently stops requiring.

    `declarable` names the checks a repository declaration may move out of
    `findings` into `declared`: the stream's *posture* checks, the ones whose
    flagged shape an owner can have chosen on purpose. Empty for a stream whose
    SOP has no declared-intent step, and empty is what it means: the validator
    rejects any `declared[]` entry whose check is not in it, so "a declaration
    justifies posture, never a fault" is an exit 2 rather than a sentence in the
    SOP. A findings document that moves `blocking-pdb` — a declared bug — into
    `declared` fails validation instead of publishing a silenced fault as
    intended. Never a superset of `checks`, never a `derived` slug;
    `test_declarable_checks_are_posture_checks_on_the_roster` holds both.

#
# The delta is a set difference over strings, so it cannot tell a renamed
# finding from a fixed one — it reports the rename as a resolution, which is
# the harness stating in writing that somebody fixed something nobody touched.
# Guarding that on the *shape* of the old ids was the first attempt and it is
# not sound: the schemes that shipped happened to be distinguishable, but the
# next change need not be, and the very first one was not. On 2026-08-03 the
# compliance ledger carried `…clusterrolebinding-argocd-application-controller`
# for a check that judges the ClusterRole; correcting the object to the role
# leaves an id of exactly the current shape and would have read as a fix.
#
# A stamp needs no cleverness: a previous body whose stamp is missing or
# different was written by a scheme this one cannot join against, whatever the
# ids look like. `resolved` is withheld for the single run it takes to rewrite
# the block, then the stamp matches and the guard lifts by itself.
#
# 2: `_shorten_id` now appends a digest when it truncates, so any id that was
# over `MAX_FINDING_ID` before shortening is spelled differently. Only those
# ids move, but the stamp is per-document and cannot say which — and the cost
# of bumping is one run of withheld `resolved`, against announcing a
# re-spelled finding as fixed.
#
# 3: the fleet-consistency-drift collector qualifies every cluster name as
# `<project>/<location>/<name>`, and the `cluster` segment is the second of
# the four `derive_finding_id` joins — so every finding that stream already
# carries is spelled differently from its first run on the new procedure.
# `derive_finding_id` itself did not change, which is precisely why the stamp
# rather than the function's shape is what this guards: the ids move because
# their input moved. The bump is global because the stamp is, so every other
# stream pays one run of withheld `resolved` for a rename in this one; a
# per-stream stamp would be the alternative, and it is a bigger change than
# the single run it would save.
#
# 4: the security-patch-orchestrator collector (`patch_readiness.py`) makes the
# same rename for its stream, for the same reason, so every patch finding is
# re-spelled on its first run under the collector and scheme 3's ledgers and
# remediation pull requests cannot be joined against it.
#
# 5: `collect.py` makes the same rename for the obtainability, compliance and
# ai-security streams, which until then published the bare names their
# documents wrote.
#
# 6: `fleet_waste.py` and `fleet_stockout.py` make the same rename for the cost
# and stockout streams, and the stockout collector also re-spells three objects:
# a quota finding names its region (`Quota/<region>:<metric>`) and an
# autoscaler finding its message id (`ScaleUpError/<message-id>`) and an
# idle reservation its zone (`Reservation/<zone>:<name>`), and the
# cost collector names a project-scoped resource's location
# (`Disk/<zone>:<name>`, likewise for addresses, forwarding rules, target
# pools, backend services and repositories), whose names are unique only per
# location. The qualified cluster names re-spell through the Scope table as
# before; these objects cannot, so those rows leave the ledger unheld on the

#
# It was `critical`. The findings graded `critical` are mostly exposure
# problems closed with `gcloud`, and the ones attracting a declarative fix are

# `major` rather than `minor` because the 21 that remain are `minor`, 15 of
# them on one stream, which would sit at `AUTO_PROMOTION_CAP` for three

# mode the collector cannot rule out, or whose grade does not speak for the fix.
#
# Nine markers. A cost collector sets `service-fronted` on an idle
# controller some Service selects, because that remediation is
# `spec.replicas: 0` and the Service loses its endpoints with the pods. The
# check measures CPU and memory; nothing in it measures a caller. On
# 2026-09-07 three findings without this gate merged unattended and stood down
# three Deployments, two of them behind forwarding rules metering hundreds of
# thousands of packets a week. `/remediate <id>` is unaffected and is the
# point: a person who reads the finding and asks for it by name has supplied
# the judgement the collector could not.
#
# The stockout collector sets `new-computeclass` on a §3.11 out-of-resources
# finding whose affected pool no existing ComputeClass owns, and on one it
# cannot place. That fix is a new class plus the workload that selects it:
# two files, where a finding carries one `remediation.path`, so the sweep's
# pull request would land a class nothing selects. `/remediate` opens the same
# one-file pull request, for a person who knows to add the selector to it.
#
# The cost collector sets `autopilot-bumped` on a sizing finding (§3.1, §3.12)
# whose `major` grade the Autopilot bump supplied rather than its magnitude.
# The bump orders the ledger -- Autopilot bills on requests -- and was written
# when the sweep promoted `critical` alone, on the explicit premise that it
# could never open a pull request. Neither check is on `MAJOR_SWEEP_CHECKS`,
# so the premise holds without the marker today; the marker names the reason
# in the ledger, and keeps the premise if either check joins that list.
#
# The next three mark a fix that is disruptive by construction, whatever
# the collector measured. Most of these checks are off `MAJOR_SWEEP_CHECKS`
# anyway; the marker is what holds a `critical` one, and what tells the
# ledger's reader why the fix waits. The cost
# collector sets `scale-to-zero` on every other §3.13 stand-down (a
# Service-selected one keeps the more specific `service-fronted`): the fix is
# `spec.replicas: 0`, and an idle reading is not proof nothing needs the
# workload. It sets `guaranteed-qos` on a §3.1 resize of a `Guaranteed` pod,
# whose request is its limit, so a number sized from an idle week becomes an
# enforcement ceiling; the SOP has that finding published as `manual`, and the
# marker keeps a `manifest` the model wrote anyway out of the sweep. The
# compliance collector sets `default-deny` on every §2.6 finding: each arm's
# fix leaves the namespace denying ingress by default, which drops every
# connection no allow rule names until the team writes those rules. The
# other three are set by `collect.py` for the same reason, on §2.7,
# §3.16 and §3.19; `collect.py`'s `TRIAGE_BY_SLUG` says what each fix risks.
#
# The text beside each marker is what the ledger prints after the finding's
# title in the "fix needs a decision" block, so a reader sees why the sweep
# passed over that one without opening it. Keep it a clause about the fix.

    Every path `start` scrubs — the run record, the declarations, the
    findings document, the workspace — is keyed by audit id alone, on one
    volume every session's shell shares. The scheduler's per-job lock keeps
    two ticks apart, but a run started from a session (the on-demand
    interim, #1876) holds no such lock, so without this a tick landing
    mid-sweep, or a second card for the same stream, wiped the first run's
    state out from under it and both `finish` calls rewrote one ledger.

    The read, the decision and the write happen under an exclusive lock on
    a sibling file (flock; every session's shell runs on the one sandbox
    pod, against the one volume), so two `start`s racing for one stream
    cannot both pass, and a stale or taken-over note is replaced by exactly
    one of them: the other reads the fresh note and is refused.

    The guard fails closed. A lock that cannot be opened or taken, or a note
    that cannot be written, is a `start` that cannot know whether a run is in
    flight, and the thing it would do next is scrub that run's state; it
    exits 2 instead and says why. Nothing else in `start` runs on a volume
    that refuses these, so failing open would buy no run that failing closed
    loses, and a `start` refused here wrote nothing, so it has nothing to
    release.

    What the guard is and is not. It keeps two well-behaved runs of one
    stream apart, and it hands a refused worker nothing to act on: no
    override flag (the CLI had `--takeover` until 2026-09-24, and both
    observation runs of #1876 saw a refused worker pass it within a minute
    over its own live run), no pid to test, no path to remove; the refusal
    text names only the stream and the time. It is not a permission
    boundary: the worker's shell is the same shell an operator would use
    on the same volume (docs/designs/agent-shell-sandboxing.md), so a
    worker set on removing a file it was never told about is outside what
    a script can stop. Releasing a stream before the TTL is an operator's
    action, described in agents/platform/cron/README.md and nowhere the
    worker reads.

    The lease spans one `start`-`finish` pair, not a loop. Eight of the nine
    SOPs run a stream repository by repository (`start --repo A; finish
    --repo A; start --repo B`), and each `finish` releases, so between two
    repositories the stream is unclaimed and a rival `start` can take it;
    the loop's next `start` is then refused. A refusal mid-loop means the
    stream was taken between repositories: the run stops there and reports
    itself partial with the remaining repositories named as not audited.
    Holding the lease across the loop needs `finish` to know it is not the
    last repository, which is the run identity that is out of scope here.

    single most distinguishing component: a 63-character namespace would eat
    the allowance and leave `…deployment-api` and `…deployment-web` both
    truncated to `d`, which is a collision, which is two findings sharing one
    row in the ledger. Longest-first keeps the segments near-equal, so identity
    degrades evenly instead of falling off one end.

    Longest-first narrows the collision window; it does not close it. Two
    Deployments in one long-named namespace under one check —
    `…-frontend-api` and `…-frontend-web` — still truncate to the same
    string, and `validate_findings` used to read that as one finding written

    refusal telling the operator two different Deployments are the same
    object. A truncated id therefore carries a digest of the id it was
    truncated from, which is what makes shortening injective in practice.

    The digest is taken over the full derived id and nothing else, so it stays
    a function of the finding alone: the same object derives the same short id
    next week whatever else that run's document happens to contain. That is
    also why the collision is not resolved at validation time — a
    disambiguator that depended on the rest of the document would rename the
    finding the week its neighbour was fixed, and a renamed finding is reported

    Scoped per cluster, not per stream: a manifest cluster marked `collected`
    is cross-checked in full — every `checks_run` entry for it must name a
    (check, cluster) pair the manifest recorded at `rc == 0` — but a cluster
    the manifest marks anything else is left to the SOP's ordinary attestation
    rules, because the collector could not cover it and a human may have
    hand-collected it instead. The two regimes never mix within one cluster:
    a `collected` cluster's entries are all manifest-checked, so a fabricated
    extra check cannot hide behind a real manual fallback on the same cluster.

    Absent-from-the-manifest is silent: a cluster in `checks_run` that the
    manifest never enumerated is not this function's business (a stream only
    partially converted to a collector, or a manifest built for a narrower
    scope) — `coverage_gaps` and the ordinary roster checks already govern
    clusters the manifest says nothing about.

    The reverse is not silent, and that asymmetry is the point. Everything
    above reads the document and asks the manifest to confirm it, which cannot
    see a cluster the document simply left out. On 2026-08-29 a patch collector
    read all four clusters and recorded nine successful checks against each;
    the findings document named one, and a document-first check had nothing to
    say about the other three. The run published "0 findings across 1 audited
    cluster(s)", declared itself CLEAN, and closed the ledger — a full-fleet
    all-clear off a quarter of the fleet, with no gap reported anywhere. So a
    `collected` cluster missing from `scope.clusters` is a rejection rather
    than a coverage gap: the collector already proved the cluster readable, so
    its absence is a defect in the document and not a condition of the fleet.

    A target the collector could *not* read is missing just as loudly. The
    rule that an unreadable target claiming checks must carry `limitations`
    only reaches a target the document mentions, and omitting it entirely
    evades that as thoroughly as it evades everything else. A collector failure
    is also the likeliest place for a finding to be hiding, so of the two ways
    to lose a target this is the worse one to lose silently. `scope.skipped` is
    the other honest home for it, and the better one when nobody checked it by
    hand: `coverage_gaps` already turns a skipped entry into a gap.

    `checks_not_applicable` is the one field that used to be uncontradictable
    — free text, outside the coverage denominator, and a check moved into it
    turns a partial run clean. The rule is corroboration, not prohibition: a
    slug is inapplicable if the collector said so, or if the collector never
    claimed a successful command for it. Only the contradiction is rejected,
    in both directions — the manifest recording a check as run and clean while
    the document takes it out of the denominator, and the document claiming a
    check ran where the collector declared it inapplicable. The second matters
    because a `commands` entry records that a *command* ran, and one command
    is routinely recorded against every slug it feeds, so the rc=0 match alone
    would corroborate a claim the collector itself denies.

    out for want of a search and enter no delta block by the standing rule.

    The held set is (the previous body's marker ids) ∩ `still_flagged_ids`,

    the model has been rejecting into a hold); `finish` files the lost-memory

    This is the clean-run counterpart of the `still_flagged_ids` subtraction

    document can name a previous finding under `resolved_because` and pass

    The inverse of `unpublished_candidates`, and the direction nothing was
    watching. That one asks what the collector saw and the document did not
    repeat; this asks what the document says the collector saw and it did not.
    A check whose command the collector ran to `rc == 0` on a cluster is
    exhaustive over that cluster — it derives its candidates from the live
    API, so an object it did not emit is an object it looked at and passed. A
    finding published under that slug for that object is a verdict attributed
    to a collector that returned the opposite one.

    A cost stream did that on 2026-09-07 and it cost two live Deployments: two
    findings filed under `idle-workload` for objects the idle check had
    declined to flag (they were half the minimum age), graded `major`, with
    `Set spec.replicas: 0` as the fix and an excerpt no format string in the
    collector produces. Both opened as pull requests and auto-merged nineteen
    seconds later.

    What this returns is used to withhold *auto*-promotion, not to drop the
    finding. Publishing it is right: the model may well have seen something,
    and the operator is the one who should hear about it. Opening a pull
    request on it with no human in the loop is the part that cannot be
    justified. `/remediate <id>` still works, and should.

    Silent on everything else. A check the collector never ran, ran to a
    non-zero `rc`, or declared not applicable corroborates nothing either way,
    and the model's own inspection is then the only reading there is — that is
    the manual fallback every stream depends on, and this must not touch it.
    Neither does a target the collector did not mark `collected`: an `rc == 0`
    command on a `gate-failed` entry is a command that ran before the read
    failed, and the SOP's manual fallback — the finding the agent collected by
    hand — is exactly what such a target carries. Only a `collected` target

    `_require_repo_relative` is a *string* check and cannot be more than that:
    it runs during validation, before the harness knows where the checkout is.
    Every string it accepts still becomes a real path, and on a real filesystem
    a relative path with no `..` in it escapes anyway the moment a directory
    component is a symlink. `manifests/vendor/x.yaml` is beyond reproach until
    `manifests/vendor` is a link to `/etc`, at which point the existence check
    passes, the snapshot reads `/etc/x.yaml`, and the contents are committed to
    a public pull request. The audit is supposed to be read-only against the
    fleet and narrow against the repo; this is the check that makes the second
    half true.

    Two independent tests, because either alone has a hole:

    * no component may be a symlink — catches an escape whose target happens to
      resolve back inside the repo today and stops being contained tomorrow,
      and stops the harness *writing through* a link;
    * the fully resolved path must sit under the fully resolved root — catches

    nothing else on the line. An unterminated fence runs to the end.

    Three times on one issue, six minutes apart, each retry prompted by the

      operator who runs this audit under their own token authors comments as
      themselves, and their `/remediate` has to keep working. An App's does
      not, because an App never carries the association.

    A refusal is one entry per comment, not per bad target, because the reply is
    posted once per comment and marked with that comment's node id. An entry
    carrying `deferred: True` is not a refusal: it names a posture `finish`
    withheld this run, or an id the collector still flags that the document
    does not carry — `collector_held` for the ids the ledger carries under
    _Held by the collector_, `collector_flagged` for the rest of the
    still-flagged set, which only the JSON line names; no coverage state
    enters either — and `reply_to_refusals` answers it on the deferred marker,
    which nothing reads as "answered", so the request stands. A target in
    `declared` — a posture a repository declaration covers, listed on the
    ledger under Declared intent — is refused with that file named, never as
    a typo; the still-flagged set has the declared ids taken out of it
    already (`still_flagged_ids`), so the two never name the same target.

    `accepted_by_comment` exists so a request that *worked* gets an answer too.
    A command that silently succeeds is indistinguishable from one that was
    never read — the requester waits, sees nothing, and comments again.

    The same reasoning covers the two ways of getting the syntax wrong. A
    `/remediate` mid-sentence and a `/remediate` with nothing after it are both
    somebody asking for a fix, and both used to produce exactly the observable
    behaviour of an audit that had not run yet. Neither is honoured — the
    line-anchored form is what keeps a quoted command from firing, and guessing
    a target from an empty one is how the wrong pull request gets opened — but
    both are now answered, once, with the syntax and the ids that would work.

    """Decide which findings become pull requests this run.

    Auto-promotion is deliberately narrow — graded at or above
    the floor (see `vouched`), `manifest`, and no live pull request on its
    branch — and capped, so one bad night cannot bury
    the repository in generated pull requests. An explicit `/remediate` bypasses
    the cap: a human asked for that one by name.

    `uncorroborated` and `triage_marked` are the two filters here that are not
    about volume. Everything else in the sweep asks whether this fix is worth
    opening unattended; those ask whether a deterministic collector agreed the
    problem exists, and whether it vouched for the fix — the only grounds on
    which opening one unattended is defensible at all. `uncorroborated_findings`
    and `triage_markers` compute the sets and give the Deployments they
    were written for. Both gate the sweep and nothing else: an explicit
    `/remediate` is handled in the loop above and never consults them. Both are
    empty on a run without a collector manifest.

    `auto_promote=False` turns the sweep off entirely and is what the `remediate`
    subcommand passes. That command is a person naming ids, and a person who
    names one id and receives six pull requests has been surprised by their own
    tool — the five they did not ask for are indistinguishable, in the
    repository, from five they did. Auto-promotion belongs to the cron, where a
    named cap and a ledger line explain it; here the request *is* the whole
    instruction.

    Two states are *not* "no pull request", and conflating them is how this goes
    wrong in opposite directions. A pull request the harness closed as stale is
    re-promotable — otherwise a finding that flaps can never be fixed again
    after its first quiet day. A pull request a human closed is not, and neither
    is one they merged: re-opening either overrules a person, daily, forever.

    `already_open` is neither promoted nor withheld — the work exists. It is
    reported so an explicit request gets an answer instead of silence. So is
    `superseded`: a request a human answered by closing the pull request.

    The cap counts findings, and a group of findings sharing a path collapses to
    one pull request, so the number of PRs opened is at most `cap`.

    `below_floor` is what the severity test alone refused — a manifest fix, on
    a finding carrying no live pull request, that neither collector filter
    stopped, graded under the floor that applied to it. It is returned so the ledger
    can name it: unlike the cap, the floor never clears on its own.

    `vouched` is the finding ids `collector_vouched_findings` clears for the
    lower floor: a check in `MAJOR_SWEEP_CHECKS`, with a collector candidate
    graded at least as high behind it. Only those are held to
    `AUTO_PROMOTION_FLOOR`; every other finding is held to
    `UNVOUCHED_PROMOTION_FLOOR`. Absent means none.

    of BODY_BUDGET is the findings budget. The hidden delta block carries the
    ids the body actually **rendered**, not the full finding set — otherwise the
    next run would read a truncated finding as resolved and announce a fix that

    None when it could not be read whole. The records keep the field names the

    `authorAssociation` — so the rules written against them did not move. Two
    of those are not in the neutral comment and are answered here:

    - `viewerDidAuthor` compares the author with the login the broker's
      `identity` names for this install's credential, and requires the
      comment's `bot` flag to agree with whether that login is an App's. The
      broker strips `[bot]` off every author, so without the flag a user
      account registered under the App's slug would read as this install, and
      its markers as the harness's own.
    - `authorAssociation`, which only `standing` reads ask for, is the answer
      to `identity`'s `canWrite` for that author: `COLLABORATOR` when it may
      write, `NONE` when it may not. An author the forge could not answer for
      makes the whole read unreadable, not a refusal: that answer is a public
      reply and a permanent marker, and a five-second outage must not write one
      to a maintainer. An automation's comment is never asked about, because
      `is_machine_author` sets it aside whatever its standing. Nor is a comment
      that names no `/remediate` and was not written by this install: nothing
      reads its standing, so it carries none, and a bystander the forge could
      not answer for does not cost every request on the thread its run.
      With `requesters` false, a request this install did not write is not
      asked about either: a reader that acts on nobody's command reads only
      `is_machine_author`'s own-comment arm, and a requester the forge could
      not answer for would otherwise hold that run for an answer it ignores.

    A read without `standing` survives an `identity` outage for the viewer:
    every comment is then not this install's, and the `bot` flag is left to
    recognise an App's own.

    """Close every open remediation PR the current findings no longer justify.

    A third reason, `shielded_ids`: a pull request whose only persisting
    findings `shield_declared_account_siblings` demoted this run proposes the
    shared-account fix for a namespace that now holds a declared workload, so
    it is closed with that reason rather than left open as the only fix there
    is — merging it would be the harm the shield exists to prevent. With
    `shielded_only`, that is the only close made: a run over partial coverage
    cannot say a finding stopped reproducing, but the shield's close rests on
    the declaration, not on what the run could read, so it still stands.
    `shielded_namespaces` are the `(cluster, namespace)` pairs `start`'s
    file declares a 2.7 workload in (the empty cluster for a fleet-wide
    item): a covered id of that check whose cluster and namespace segments
    match is shielded whatever workload it names, so a pull request in such a
    namespace closes even when this run read none of it. Where an id lives
    comes first from the pull request's own body: the `Where:` line under
    each covered finding, which `parse_finding_locations` reads back, is the
    one artifact that always holds a covered id beside its cluster and
    namespace, whatever the store remembers. Then from `finding_places`, the
    segments re-derived from the finding's own fields in the stored or
    current document (`report_finding_places`). An id neither carries is read
    off the string, which is exact for an unclipped id; one shaped like a
    clipped id (ending in the shortening digest) is not matched at all, since
    its trimmed segments could equal another namespace's.

    Two reasons a pull request is stale, and the second one is why this cannot
    just read the hidden block. A pull request is stale when every finding it
    covers has stopped reproducing — and also when its branch is no longer any
    group's branch, which happens whenever a group splits or merges because its
    file set changed. The second rule subsumes the first for grouped findings
    and catches the orphans the first rule cannot see.

    `branch_by_finding` maps each still-live finding to the branch its group is
    on this run. A plain set of branch names is not enough: the orphan rule has
    to tell "this work moved to another branch" from "this work has no branch
    at all", and only the second is a reason to leave a pull request open.

    The branch is never deleted: if the finding returns, the audit pushes to it
    again. The `audit:stale-closed` label is applied *before* the close and the
    close is abandoned if the label does not stick, so a later run can always
    tell this close from a human's rejection. The comment is posted at most once
    but the close is retried until it succeeds — the marker records that the
    announcement happened, not that the pull request shut.

    Lazy and idempotent: the first run of a stream clones, later ones fetch.
    Nothing in the pod does this at startup, and nothing should — a clone baked
    into the image is stale before the first cron fires.

    The lease is the audit id, which makes the path deterministic across the
    two invocations of a run: `start` and `finish` are separate processes and
    must land in the same tree. It also gives each audit stream a tree of its
    own, so two whose schedules collide no longer interleave `checkout -B`,
    `add` and `push` in one working directory. `validate_audit_id` has already
    constrained the id to a closed enum, so it is a safe path segment by
    construction.

    `reset` scrubs the working tree, and only `start` may ask for it. Between
    `start` and `finish` the agent writes its remediation manifests into this
    tree; they are untracked until a remediation branch stages them, so a reset
    on the way into `finish` would delete every fix the audit just wrote and
    then report each one as a file the model forgot to produce.

    directory the agent writes manifests into, and the repository lives in the

    In directory mode the working tree is restored to the branch and file

    restore: no branch is switched and no file in the scratch tree is written,

    it is what gets sent — but the checkout, the restore, and the promise the

    A group that fails to publish is logged and skipped rather than aborting
    the run. The ledger is already written by this point, and it records the
    finding as having no pull request — so the next run simply tries again.
