"""report_status.py — the read side of the fleet-audit report store.

Projects `reports/<audit-id>/<owner>/<name>/{latest.json, runs/}` and the
in-flight notes `start` leaves in the scratch directory into one small JSON
document: each stream's liveness and, per repository it publishes to, the last
run's outcome without its findings document and the run ring's filenames. Design of record: docs/designs/fleet-audit-report-store.md.

Two consumers, each pinning one property of this file:

- `scripts/fleet_audit_status_view.py` runs it off-pod by streaming this file
  into the pod on stdin (`kubectl exec -i … -- python3 -`), which keeps the
  view working against an image built before this file was. Streamed stdin has
  no `__file__`, so nothing here may reference one, import a sibling module,
  or reach outside the standard library.
- `fleet-audit-reports/scripts/report_query.py` imports the reading helpers
  below so the two do not grow two parsers of the same files. The module
  therefore does no work at import time: every entry point is a function and
  the CLI sits behind `__main__`.

`root_exists` and the per-stream `error` are the keys that make failure
legible: "I could not look" must never render as "nothing is wrong".
