        # rather than anything this code can predict. At a limit of 10 the ranking
        # therefore re-sorted an arbitrary handful and a P0 outside it was never a
        # candidate — the delay the ranking was added to remove. Widening the window
        # is what makes the ranking mean anything, and 100 covers the whole
        # unaddressed backlog of a repository this agent is plausibly pointed at.
        # It is affordable only because `comments` is dropped — that field costs one
        # GraphQL round trip per issue, so asking for it across 100 issues is what
        # would blow `github_scan_gate`'s RESOLVER_TIMEOUT_S. The winner's comments
        # are fetched on their own below, once there is exactly one issue to fetch
        # them for; that is one list call plus one view call, against the ten
        # issues' worth of comment round trips the old projection paid every tick.
