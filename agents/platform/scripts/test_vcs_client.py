"""vcs_client.py as a library: the shape a consumer script imports, not the CLI.

The command-line suite (`skills/version-control/scripts/test_vcs.py`) drives
every operation through `vcs.py`, which is a thin front over this module; what
that suite cannot show is that the module stands on its own for a caller that
never builds an argparse namespace. These tests are that caller.
