"""Broker-owned git working trees the agent never gets a path to.

Why this exists
---------------
Today the agent authors files on a shared volume and the broker runs `git` in
that same directory, at a working directory the agent chooses and reports. Every
config-driven code-execution path found against the broker follows from that one
arrangement: a repo-local `.git/config` the agent can write is read by a `git`
holding the cloud credentials, and `.git/hooks/pre-commit` needs no unusual argv
at all — an ordinary `git commit` runs it.

That surface cannot be closed by enumeration. `filter.<name>.smudge` and
`alias.<name>` take an arbitrary name *inside* the config key, so there is no
finite set of keys to deny, and `url.<host>.insteadOf` survives every transport
control because the attacker's URL is `https` too.

So the boundary moves. The agent stops handing over a directory and starts
handing over content: `{path, bytes}` pairs plus a branch and a message. The
broker owns the tree, on its own volume, and the agent has no name for it. There
is no `.git` for the agent to write into because there is no path it can reach.

What is a control here and what is only geometry
------------------------------------------------
Two different things hold this together and they are not equally strong.

*Structural, and checked:* `assert_disjoint_roots` refuses to arm the feature if
the tree root and the agent-shared workspace root overlap. That is an executed
property rather than a comment, which is the point — a future edit that points
both at the same volume fails at startup instead of silently reopening
everything above.

*Geometry, and not checked here:* in the sidecar deployment the tree root lives
on the broker's own emptyDir, which the agent container does not mount. Nothing
in this process can verify that. It is the same argument the credential proxy
already makes twice — about `$HOME/.gitconfig` and about `KUBECTL_KUBERC` — and
it is exactly as weak here as it is there. The operator can defeat it in one
line of a PlatformAgent CR, because `spec.deployment.extraVolumeMounts` is
appended to the agent container unvalidated. The genuinely structural version of
this is the pod split, where there is no shared mount to name.

Paths are validated once, in `repo_relative`, and the same validator runs on
reads and on writes. One parser, both directions: a checker that disagrees with
itself about what `manifests/../.git/config` means is the defect class that has
produced every Critical in this project so far.

Two things that are easy to state and were not true until they were enforced.
No response carries an absolute filesystem path — including the error
responses, which is where one leaks, because git quotes paths in its own
messages and nobody writes an error thinking about it. `_redact` is what makes
that a property rather than an intention, and it scrubs every absolute path
rather than the two this module happens to know the names of. And every verb takes a lock for its
whole duration, because the handler is threaded and each verb is a
read-then-act on a tree another verb may delete or reset underneath it.

        # `close` -- the verb an operator reaches for when they want the tree

        Every docstring in this module says no response carries a filesystem

        enforcing it: git's own errors quote absolute paths freely (`fatal:
        could not create work tree dir '<root>/<handle>/repo'`), and `_git` puts
        500 bytes of stderr on the wire. An error message is exactly where a
        path leaks, because nobody writes an error message thinking about it.

        Three passes, widening. The tree root and the handle are the two that
        matter, and they get their own markers so the message still reads. The
        third pass takes out *any* remaining absolute path, and it is the one
        that makes the claim true rather than nearly true: a first version of

        is one the broker really can emit, because `$HOME` is deliberately the

        is another. Neither is agent-writable and neither is worth much to an
