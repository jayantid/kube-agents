"""Slack presentation for kube-agents: answer layout, buttons, reports and reactions.

Nothing here imports the Hermes gateway, the Slack SDK or the network, and
every function is pure but :func:`enabled`, which reads the environment, and
:func:`ack_link_click`, the coroutine a caller registers to acknowledge a
link-button click, so any process that posts to
Slack can use it, and it can move with Slack ingress when it leaves the
gateway. Its callers include the gateway patches for reactions
(``slack_ux_reactions``, which the kanban notifier also reaches), plan and
session status (``slack_ux_status``, which reads only :func:`enabled`), moments
(``slack_ux_moments``, which reads :func:`enabled` and lays out through
``slack_moments``), incident triage (``slack_ux_incident``), a finished card's
answer (``slack_ux_answer``, through :func:`split_lead`), button clicks
(``slack_ux_clicks``), failure replies (``slack_ux_failure``, which bolds
with ``_first_sentence`` and adds its offer with :func:`blocks_answer`) and
the harness-message patch (``slack_boilerplate``, which reads only :func:`enabled`);
the Chat Agent's ``bootstrap_delivery``, which lays out the first inventory
report through ``inventory_presenter``; and ``session_kv_server``'s cron relay,
which gates the fleet-audit report on :func:`enabled` and lays it out through
``slack_audit_report``.
Every caller reaches it through ``PYTHONPATH=/opt/defaults/scripts``, which the
operator sets on the agent container.

Everything a caller changes on screen is gated on :func:`enabled`, the
``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` environment variable, off by default. With it off, callers
take their upstream path unchanged; this module only answers questions.

Layout: :func:`split_answer` takes the headline off an agent's markdown
answer, and :func:`split_lead` the same first sentence as written; link
buttons, none for a url :func:`_safe_link_url` refuses, and choice buttons,
whose value the caller sets, are built by ``_button`` and wrapped into rows by
``_actions``; :func:`fallback_text`
is the headline, links and choices as plain mrkdwn, for the message's ``text``
field, with any report rows led by their severity as inline code (a bullet when
they have none).
:func:`blocks_answer` lays a headline, links and choices out as blocks; its
callers are ``slack_moments``, which lays out the messages ``slack_ux_moments``
posts, and ``slack_ux_failure``, which adds a failure reply's offer button.
:func:`with_side_bar` puts every block below the headline in one legacy
attachment whose ``color`` is the side bar, for ``slack_ux_moments`` posting and
settling a moment and ``slack_ux_clicks`` rewriting one; :func:`message_blocks`
and :func:`side_bar_color` read a click's echoed message back.

Reports (:func:`blocks_report`): a headline, the top findings as one group
between dividers, then the choice buttons and the link buttons. Block Kit has no bordered box a message
can draw, so the dividers stand in for a border. :func:`names_gap` and
:func:`as_line` find and set out a report's line saying what was not scanned.

Reactions (:func:`arrival_reaction`, :func:`settle_reaction`): the first
reaction says what kind of ask arrived, chosen by keyword before any model
call, and comes off when the answer posts. ⏸️ stands while the work waits on
the user, and ❌ marks work that failed; work that succeeded is left with none.
