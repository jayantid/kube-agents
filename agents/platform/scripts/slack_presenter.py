"""Slack presentation for kube-agents: answer layout, buttons and reactions.

Nothing here imports the Hermes gateway, the Slack SDK or the network, and
every function is pure but :func:`enabled`, which reads the environment, and
:func:`ack_link_click`, the coroutine a caller registers to acknowledge a
link-button click, so any process that posts to
Slack can use it, and it can move with Slack ingress when it leaves the
gateway. Its callers include the gateway patches for reactions
(``slack_ux_reactions``, which the kanban notifier also reaches), plan and
session status (``slack_ux_status``, which reads only :func:`enabled`), moments
(``slack_ux_moments``, which reads :func:`enabled` and lays out through
``slack_moments``), incident triage (``slack_ux_incident``) and button clicks
(``slack_ux_clicks``).
Every caller reaches it through ``PYTHONPATH=/opt/defaults/scripts``, which the
operator sets on the agent container.

Everything a caller changes on screen is gated on :func:`enabled`, the
``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` environment variable, off by default. With it off, callers
take their upstream path unchanged; this module only answers questions.

Layout: :func:`split_answer` takes the headline off an agent's markdown
answer; link buttons, none for a url :func:`_safe_link_url` refuses, and choice
buttons, whose value the caller sets, are built by ``_button`` and wrapped into
rows by ``_actions``; :func:`fallback_text`
is the headline, links and choices as plain mrkdwn, for the message's ``text``
field.
:func:`blocks_answer` lays a headline, links and choices out as blocks; its
caller is ``slack_moments``, which lays out the messages ``slack_ux_moments``
posts.

Reactions (:func:`arrival_reaction`, :func:`settle_reaction`): the first
reaction says what kind of ask arrived, chosen by keyword before any model
call; a second joins it when the work settles. The first is never removed; the
credential proxy refuses every Slack method ending in ``remove``.
