"""Slack presentation for kube-agents: the reactions an ask gets.

Pure functions only. Nothing here imports the Hermes gateway, the Slack SDK or
the network, so any process that posts to Slack can use it, and it can move
with Slack ingress when it leaves the gateway. Today its one caller is the
gateway's reactions patch (``slack_ux_reactions``), which the kanban notifier
also reaches.
Every caller reaches it through ``PYTHONPATH=/opt/defaults/scripts``, which the
operator sets on the agent container.

Everything a caller changes on screen is gated on :func:`enabled`, the
``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` environment variable, off by default. With it off, callers
take their upstream path unchanged; this module only answers questions.

Reactions (:func:`arrival_reaction`, :func:`settle_reaction`): the first
reaction says what kind of ask arrived, chosen by keyword before any model
call; a second joins it when the work settles. The first is never removed; the
credential proxy refuses every Slack method ending in ``remove``.
