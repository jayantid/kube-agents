"""vcs_client.py — the version-control verbs, as a library the sandbox's Python can import.

`vcs.py` is the command line the model drives; this is the same thing for the
scripts that used to shell `gh` and the credential shim -- the issue resolver,
the suggestion submitter, the pull-request scan gate -- so that a consumer
reaches a forge the way the skill does: one broker call per verb, a working copy
with no remote and no credential for everything local. Extracted rather than
reimplemented, so the callers cannot drift.

Everything that spends a credential goes through `call()`, which is
`POST /v1/vcs/<verb>` on the credential broker. Everything else runs the
sandbox's own git, by absolute path, against a copy `clone()` unpacked from a
bundle. The session store under `ROOT/.sessions` remembers, per working copy,
which branch the copy was cloned from and what each branch last published --
the two facts `publish()` proves its revisions against.

The operations mirror the command line: `capabilities`, `clone`, `branch`,
`commit`, `publish`, `discard`, `forge(verb, payload)` for the collaboration
verbs, and `local(session, args, verb)` for a read. Each returns the JSON the
command line would have printed and raises `VcsError` where it would have
printed one.

    branch — without ever checking the objects out. So the revision identifiers
    on the forge are the ones `log` printed here.

    The default `target` is the branch the copy was cloned from. While the
    broker pins this repository's proposals to a base (`baseBranch` from
    `clone`), that is the base: a copy cloned of some other branch has no
    default, because its revisions were cut from that branch, not from the
    base, so it is refused here, before anything is bundled.

    `advance` says this copy was cloned *of* a proposal branch in order to add
    to it, which is the one reason to publish the branch the copy came down on.
    It needs an explicit `target` beside it — the branch the proposal merges
    into. The pinned base is not its default: the proposal may have been opened
    onto another branch, and only the caller knows which.
