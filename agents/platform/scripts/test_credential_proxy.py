    The reply crosses back into the agent sandbox and the caller renders the
    resulting reason code into a chat room, so it stays output-free. The
    helper's stderr carries the broker's actual refusal and is the only thing
    an operator has to read, so it has to reach the sidecar's own log.

    The split lives on the executor rather than on the route because the route
    is not the only caller: a forge's credential strategy asks for the same
    operation in-process, and a diagnosis only the HTTP path logged would be
    absent for exactly the clone that failed.
