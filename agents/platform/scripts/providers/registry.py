"""Which forges exist, how many of each this install has, and which one a URL is.

The one shared file a new forge edits, and it edits it twice: an import line
and an entry in `AVAILABLE`. Nothing else here changes, and nothing downstream
of `build_forges` changes at all.

The tension this resolves is that a registry should know nothing about a forge,
while a self-managed host is not knowable at import time -- there may be zero of
them or four, and their hostnames come from configuration. Asking the *class*
how many of itself this install has is the only version of that question that
does not put a hostname in a shared file.
