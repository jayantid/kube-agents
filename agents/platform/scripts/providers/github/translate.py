"""GitHub's JSON, turned into the concepts every forge has under another name.

This is where GitHub's vocabulary stops. A caller that received `head.ref`,
`author_association` and `merged_at` would be a GitHub client wearing a neutral
URL, and the second forge would be a second client rather than a second class.

Kept apart from `forge.py` because the two answer different questions --
`forge.py` says which call to make, this says what came back means -- and
because the recorded responses under `testdata/providers/github/` are tested against
this file alone.

    Three states, not GitHub's two plus a timestamp. Closed and merged are
    different outcomes on every forge, and a caller should not have to know
    that GitHub encodes the difference in a nullable date field.

    `source` is a branch name and says nothing about where that branch lives.
    `sourceRepo` is the repository it lives in, and the two have to be read
    together: a proposal opened from a fork carries the bare branch name, so a
    caller deciding "did I open this, from a branch I wrote" on `source` alone
    accepts any fork's branch of the same name. It is `""` when the fork has
    been deleted, which is the forge saying it no longer knows -- distinct from
    naming this repository, and a caller that treats the two alike will amend a
    branch under a name a stranger chose.

    `sourceRevision` is that branch's tip as of this read, and is deliberately
    a property of the read rather than of the proposal: the question it
    answers -- did anything land here after the request I am replying to -- is
    only sound against a tip re-read at the moment of asking. That holds while
    the proposal is open. Once it is closed or merged GitHub stops following
    the branch and the field is the revision it closed at, however the branch
    moves afterwards -- which is what `branch-delete` relies on to tell a spent
    branch from one that moved on.
