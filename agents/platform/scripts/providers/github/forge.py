"""GitHub: which calls to make, and nothing about how they are made.

Only the API is used, never `gh pr` or `gh issue`. Those subcommands infer the
repository from a nearby `.git/config` -- the one file this whole design exists
to keep out of the credentialed process -- and they format for a human, which
is not something a translation can be written against. So this class is a REST
client's *description* of a REST client: it names paths, parameters and bodies,
and the transport the broker built for it does the calling.

`transport = "cli"` is the only reason `gh` is in the broker image at all: it
was already there for the App installation flow, so borrowing it costs nothing.
That is a fact about this install's history rather than about GitHub, which is
why it is one word here and not a shape the interface has to have.

        for issues and got proposals mixed in would have to know that. The
        `pull_request` key is how they are told apart, and it is applied after
        the page is fetched, so a label proposals share can fill a whole page
