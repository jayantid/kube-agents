"""How a forge's token is acquired, and how it is presented -- one object.

Four things about a credential differ per forge, and the natural place to put
each of them is a different one: whether it expires (nowhere -- it is assumed),
how it is acquired (the process holding the privilege), how the API presents it
(inside whichever client makes the call), and how `git` presents it (a side
effect of acquisition). Every one of those is defensible alone and the set is
wrong, because they are four views of one question -- how is *this* forge's
token presented -- and scattering them is what allows the fourth to become
invisible. It has been invisible before: `gh auth setup-git` writes a global
git credential helper as an undeclared side effect of authenticating the API,
which is why `git clone` works in a design where nothing says it should.

So: one object, which the forge constructs and owns, holding all three.
Acquisition is a strategy the forge *selects*, not a pipeline every forge is
fitted into -- a forge whose token does not expire says so by choosing a
strategy that has nothing to do, rather than by implementing a method that
returns immediately.

A credential may not run a subprocess, for the same reason a forge may not: the
broker owns process execution. A strategy that needs a privileged act names it
and the executor performs it. Three roles, cleanly separated -- the forge
chooses the strategy, the strategy names the privileged operation, the executor
performs it.

    reads like the repository is gone; the alternative to refreshing eagerly is
    that the first verb after an idle hour fails once, for a reason the caller
    cannot act on. Acquisition is idempotent and costs one local process.

    A failure here is logged and not raised. The broker may already hold a
    valid token, in which case the verb about to run succeeds and a refusal
    would have been the only thing that failed.

    `PermissionError` is the exception, and it is not a failure to refresh. The

    current, and is this a repository the install acts on -- and the second is
    an authorization decision. Swallowing it would let a verb proceed against a
    repository that was just refused, on a token that is valid, which is the
    only shape of "refresh failed" that must stop the verb.

    `headers` and `git_config` are both empty, and that is a statement rather

    on the API side and installs a git credential helper on the git side, so

    strategy cannot cross: the brokered token is installed once, ambiently, in
    a helper every git in the sidecar consults, and it is a write token. A
    context repository must never be reached on that token, so this one is
    never installed anywhere. `ensure` asks the executor to mint it, `git_config`
    hands it to the one git invocation the caller is about to run as an
    `extraheader`, and the process it was handed to is the only place it ever
    lives. The same layer clears `credential.helper`, with or without a
    token: the ambient helper is never consulted for a context repository,
    so the line holds when the mint fails as well as when it succeeds.

    Two things are asymmetric with `BrokeredCredential`, on purpose:

    * A failed mint is swallowed, `PermissionError` included, and the caller
      proceeds with no credential. The refusal there stops a verb from running
      on a *valid* token against a repository just refused; here there is no
      token when the mint is refused, so proceeding means a credential-less
      clone, with the helper cleared so it is one: a public repository reads
      as it always did, and a private one fails on the missing token rather
      than being tried on the write one.
    * `headers` is empty. The API side is not part of the read path: a context
