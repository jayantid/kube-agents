"""GitLab: which calls to make, and nothing about how they are made.

One class serves gitlab.com and every self-managed instance: the registry
builds one instance per configured host, and the host is the only thing that
differs between them. The transport is the broker's in-process HTTP client;
the credential is a token an administrator stored in a Secret -- a group or
project access token, or, on gitlab.com's Free tier where those do not exist,
a personal access token of an account that exists for this install. The
mechanism is the same for all three; what differs is how far the token
reaches, which is why `allowed_paths` is enforced here before a credential is
spent and the broker's managed list is enforced before that.

What GitLab's API does differently from the shapes every caller expects, and
where it is absorbed:

- a project is addressed as one URL-encoded segment, `quote(path, safe="")`.
  The default `quote` leaves `/` alone, which GitLab reads as a different
  route, and the 404 that answers it reads like a permissions problem;
- every number is an `iid`, never an `id` (see `translate.py`);
- states are `opened`/`closed`/`merged` on the way in as well as out;
- a draft is a title prefix, because the `draft` field is ignored when a merge
  request is created;
- notes carry GitLab's own bookkeeping, which is not a conversation;
- `raw_diffs` answers 5xx until GitLab has computed the diff, so a diff falls
  back to the JSON `diffs` endpoint and is assembled from it.
