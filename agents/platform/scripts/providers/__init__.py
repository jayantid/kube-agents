"""The forge abstraction: everything a forge is written against, and the forges.

This module is the whole of the package's public surface. Nothing outside
`providers/` imports `providers.something` -- a rule the import-boundary test
enforces -- so what is re-exported here is exactly what the broker and its
tests are allowed to see, and the submodules stay free to be reorganised
without a search-and-replace across the repository.

The split inside is by who owns the decision. These shared modules hold
everything a forge needs to be written against; a forge package holds
everything only that forge knows. The broker holds what is true regardless of
forge and names no forge at all.
