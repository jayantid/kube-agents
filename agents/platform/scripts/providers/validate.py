"""The validators every forge's verbs run on their arguments.

Shared rather than per-forge because the thing being validated is the caller's
request, not the forge's API. `limit` bounds a page because a listing nobody
reads to the end is a listing that should not have been fetched; `branch`
refuses `HEAD` because pushing a ref by that name breaks every later clone.
Neither fact belongs to any one forge.

Two of these run twice on the same value -- once in the sandbox client, once
here -- and that is deliberate. The client's copy turns a mistake into a
message before a request is spent; this copy is the one that is load-bearing,
because it is the one on the side that holds the credential.
