"""What a forge is, expressed as the ten things that differ between forges.

Less differs than it looks. Cloning, bundling, the publish safety checks, the
scratch lifecycle, the size ceilings and every subprocess belong to the broker
and are the same everywhere. A forge decides which hostnames are its own, what
a URL of its names, where to clone from, which of the collaboration verbs it
serves, how its credential is acquired and presented, which transport reaches
its API, how many instances of itself this install has -- and, for each verb it
serves, what to ask for and how to translate the answer.

Two members are worth reading twice, because they are the ones a
single-forge design would not have.

`transport` is a *declaration*, not an implementation. The forge names what it
needs and the broker constructs it. That keeps the rule that a forge says what
to call and never how to execute it, while allowing a transport that is not a
subprocess -- which is what an interface shaped as `api_command() -> argv`
would have ruled out without ever saying so.

`for_config` is what lets the registry stay ignorant of any particular forge.
Of a hosted forge an install has exactly one or none; of a self-managed one it
may have four, at hostnames chosen by whoever runs them. Asking the class how
many of itself to build is the only version of that question that does not put
a hostname in a shared file.

What a forge may **not** do, in any implementation:

- run a subprocess, or choose a working directory for one
- choose a scratch path, or set a timeout, or bypass a size ceiling
- reach the network except through the transport the broker built for it

Those are not style rules. On `main` a single executor is the one place that
applies the executable allowlist, the argv refusal list, `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`,
the forced git config, `GIT_EDITOR=false`, and the timeout and output ceilings.
A forge that ran its own subprocess would be a second path past all of them,
and the controls would still look present in the file that no longer decides.
