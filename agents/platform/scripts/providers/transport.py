"""How a described API call actually gets made.

A verb describes the call it wants and the transport makes it. The split is
what keeps the rule that a forge says *what* to call and never *how* to execute
it, while still allowing a transport that is not a subprocess -- which is the
case a `api_command(...) -> argv` interface would have quietly ruled out.

The neutral request is:

    api(method, path, *, params=None, body=None, raw=None) -> Any

`params` is a dict rather than something a verb formats into the path, because
a dict is what gets URL-encoded; `f"...?state={state}"` does not. `raw` names a
media type rather than smuggling one through as a header, so a transport with
no notion of headers can still honour it.

What a transport owns, and no forge may:

- the executable, when there is one, and the working directory it runs in
- the timeout and the output ceiling, both of which come from the runner the
  broker hands in
- recovering a status from a failure -- an integer for an HTTP client, a parse
  of `(HTTP 404)` out of stderr for a CLI. That parse is a property of how the
  call was made, not of what the forge answered, which is why it is here and
  not in `errors.py`.
