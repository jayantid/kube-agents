"""repo_ref.py — one repository identity, parsed once and passed.

What this replaces
------------------
`owner/repo` used to be asserted in a handful of Python modules, each with its
own regex and its own way of saying no: some raised, some returned `None`, some
returned `False`. No module could see what another was asserting, so the shapes
drifted — `credential_proxy.is_valid_repository` accepted `acme/..` that every
other copy rejected, and `audit_report` matched the bare regex directly rather
than the validator wrapping it. `docs/designs/version-control-support.md` has the
census, under "Repository identity".

A `RepoRef` carries a host and an opaque path of arbitrary depth. The
two-segment rule is not an invariant of this module: it is a property of
GitHub, checked by the callers that need it (`github_slug` and friends below).
That split is what that section asks for, and it is
why a GitLab `group/subgroup/project` parses here and is refused only where a
GitHub slug is actually required.

Why it imports nothing but the standard library
-----------------------------------------------
`credential_proxy.py` is a caller and runs in the sidecar — the container that
holds the credentials, under a different UID from the agent. A validator on
that boundary must not pull in `gitops_workspace`, which shells `kubectl`.
Standard library only, and no module-level I/O.

On the host
-----------
A host is read only where the syntax states one: a scheme (`https://host/path`)
or an scp-style remote (`[user@]host:path`). A schemeless slash-path has no
host, because inferring one would read `my.org/repo` as a host and a
single-segment path — and `my.org` is a legal owner in the bare form the
operator writes through verbatim. The one exception is `KNOWN_HOSTS`: a
schemeless value whose first segment is a spelling of a forge this harness
knows does name that host, which is what keeps `github.com/owner/repo` working.

That exception is recorded rather than hidden. A ref carries `host_inferred`,
and the lift is the only thing that sets it, because the shorthand is right for
one kind of caller and wrong for another. A repository *registration* is a
value a person configured, and `github.com/o/r` is exactly the shorthand they
type. A *git remote* is a value git produced, and git produces no such thing:
`git remote add origin github.com/acme/toolkit` is accepted, but as a relative
local path, not a GitHub URL. A caller reading a remote therefore wants
`host_stated`, and `github_token_refresh.github_repo_from_remote` is the one
that does — otherwise a directory path in a `.git/config` the sandbox controls
would mint an installation token for whatever org it named.
