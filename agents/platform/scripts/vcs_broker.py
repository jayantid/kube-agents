"""Version control as concepts: the `/v1/vcs/*` broker routes.

The credential is here and the working copy is not. A caller in the sandbox
names a repository by URL and asks for the things version control is for; every
one of them is answered by this process, which holds the token, on behalf of a
process that does not.

Three properties are the whole design.

*The forge is decided here.* Which forge a URL belongs to and which credential
opens it are the same question, and the answer belongs beside the credential. A
sandbox that had to tell one forge from another would be a second place that
has to agree, and adding a forge would mean shipping two images instead of one.
So the caller sends a URL, the registry maps its host through a configured
table, and a host with no entry is refused by name rather than attempted with
whatever credential happens to be loaded. That table is also the security
boundary: a caller-chosen URL decides where a token gets sent, and an allowlist
is what stops "clone this repository" from meaning "post my credential there".

*Nothing crosses this seam in a forge's own vocabulary.* The forge's API is
called from this process because this is where its credential lives, and its
JSON stops here. What goes back is a normalised proposal, issue or comment --
the concepts every forge has under a different name. A caller that received one
forge's field names would be that forge's client wearing a neutral URL, and the
second forge would be a second client rather than a second directory.

*History moves as bundles, in both directions, and is never checked out here.*
`clone` clones, bundles, and deletes the tree before it answers. `publish` takes
a bundle of the caller's new revisions, fetches it into a scratch repository,
checks that it says what it claims to say, and pushes the branch -- without ever
running a `checkout`. That last part is what makes accepting caller-supplied
objects safe: a `.gitattributes` naming a filter driver, a `.gitmodules`, a file
called `.gitconfig` are all inert as long as nothing materialises them into a
working copy beside the token. Objects and refs are data; a checkout is what
turns them into behaviour.

The routes are stateless. There is no handle, nothing survives a request, and
two concurrent requests share nothing but the lock the HTTP layer holds.

This file names no forge, and a test enforces that. Everything a forge decides
is behind `providers`; everything here is true whatever forge the URL named.

On the vocabulary
-----------------
The verb names are the version-control concepts rather than one system's
spelling of them, because the caller is a language model and the concepts are
what it was trained on. Where the systems disagree the neutral name wins and the
familiar one is an alias: `annotate` over `blame`, which is what Mercurial,
Subversion, Bazaar and jj all call per-line attribution and which git itself
accepts; `publish` over `push`, because sending revisions to the shared
repository is the concept and `push` is the DVCS spelling that invites `--force`
and an `origin` this design does not have. On the collaboration side the neutral
noun is `proposal`, after Launchpad's "merge proposal" -- the term `breezy` and
`silver-platter` settled on for exactly this problem -- with `pr` and `mr` as
aliases, since "pull request" carries a fork-and-branch assumption not every
forge shares and Gerrit's unit of review is a single revision.
`docs/designs/version-control-support.md` records the sources.

        a caller that dies mid-request costs the broker nothing.

        an omission. `git bundle create` in a shallow repository succeeds and

        not carry; cloning it fails with "remote did not send all necessary

        it makes the clone single-branch.

        proposal is cut from, and the base is the only target the proposal

        The branch must not be the remote's default branch, whatever `target`
        says. Every ancestry check below passes for a fast-forward of the
        shared branch, and both `branch` and `target` are fields the sandbox
        chose -- so a guard that only compared the two was defeated by naming
        any other existing branch as the target. The default branch is the one
        fact about "shared" the broker can learn from the remote itself.

        The branch must not be the target either. That closes the same door for
        a copy cloned from a branch that is not the default, where the broker
        has nothing to check against but what the caller declared. `advance`
        waives the declared half of that pair and nothing else -- it is how a
        caller says the branch it cloned is a proposal branch it is here to add
        to, which is the one case where writing to it is the whole point.

        The bundle must carry exactly the branch it claims. A bundle holding a
        second ref would publish something the caller did not declare, and a
        fetch of one ref would leave the rest unmentioned in the answer.

        Its tip must descend from the revision the caller was handed by `clone`.
        That is what makes this an extension of known history rather than a
        replacement of it.

        The target branch's current tip must also be an ancestor, checked after
        the fetch that learns it. Between `clone` and `publish` somebody else may
        have pushed, and without this the caller's branch would silently discard
        that work.

        And nothing is ever checked out. The scratch repository is fetched into
        and pushed from, never materialised into a working copy, so no
        `.gitattributes`, hook, or `.gitmodules` among the incoming objects has

        The write that lets a derived branch name be used twice. Every refusal
        below is about keeping it to exactly that, because a delete is the one
        write in this table that takes something off the forge rather than
        adding to it.

        The branch must be under `AGENT_BRANCH_PREFIX`. Outside it the branch
        is a person's, or another tool's, and nothing this install learns about
        its history makes it this install's to remove. The prefix is a
        convention, not a lock -- anyone who can push can push under it -- so
        the proposal that carried the tip must also be this install's: opened
        by the credential's own login, from this repository rather than a fork.
        So must every other proposal the branch's history lists: a branch a
        person ever proposed from is theirs too, whatever this install later
        opened on it. All of them, so a history the forge answers in more than
        one page is refused rather than judged on the first. A credential that cannot name itself leaves the prefix and the
        same-repository rule as the bar, the same weaker bar `advance` settles for and for the reason
        `_viewer` gives; one whose lookup failed is refused, since that
        silence is an outage rather than an answer.

        It must not be protected, by the same rule `publish` applies -- the
        remote's own default branch included, which is the one fact about
        "shared" the broker learns from the remote rather than the request.

        No proposal on it may be open. An open proposal is somebody's work in
        review, and its branch is that work.

        And its tip must be the last revision of a merged or closed proposal
        from it. That is what "spent" means, checked rather than claimed: a
        branch that moved on after its proposal closed holds revisions no
        proposal carried, and deleting it would lose them. On the shipped forge
        the revision the proposal carried stays reachable from the proposal
        itself, so what this removes is a name, not work.

        These gates hold against a mistake, not against their own caller: the
        same caller can open a proposal from a branch with `proposal-create`
        and close it, which makes the tip carried and the carrier this
        install's -- the bar `advance` states for itself. What that caller
        still cannot do is lose work: the revision it made carried stays
        reachable from the proposal it opened, and a branch a person proposed
        from is refused above whatever this install opened on it since.

        `revision` is the tip the caller last read, from `branch-view`, and the
        delete is conditional on it: a sibling that published to the same name
        in between wins, and this refuses rather than removing what it pushed.
        A branch that is already gone is not an error -- the caller wanted it
        gone -- and is answered with `deleted: false`.
