"""Unit tests for the submit-suggestion skill's PR submitter.

The subject lives in `agents/platform/skills/submit-suggestion/scripts/`, but
the test lives here: CI discovers tests in exactly two directories
(.github/workflows/python-tests.yml), and that is not one of them. Loading it by
path keeps the coverage without a third discovery step.

Run:
  python3 -m unittest discover -s agents/platform/scripts -p 'test_submit_suggestion.py' -v

Real git against a local repository throughout, with the broker faked at the
one seam the script has: `vcs_client.call`. A recorded runner on this side
would make most of it vacuous — whether a second round extends a branch or
diverges from it is a question only real objects answer — while a real broker
would need a credential CI does not have. So the fake serves bundles out of a
real repository and pushes them back into it, and the proposals it keeps are a
table.
