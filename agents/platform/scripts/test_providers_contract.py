"""One suite, run against every forge this install has, not one file per forge.

Each forge ships a directory of recorded API responses under
`testdata/providers/<forge name>/` -- the JSON its host actually returns for each
verb it claims to serve -- and this suite reads them. Test input lives with the
tests, not inside the package the images ship. The assertions are about the *neutral* shape: that a proposal
has three states rather than one forge's two-plus-a-timestamp, that a listing
says when it is truncated, that a verb a forge does not serve refuses by name.

The point of the inversion is where the cost of a second forge falls. A file
per forge means holding a new one to the same assertions is a shared-test edit
somebody has to remember; here a new forge adds its recordings under `testdata/`
and this file does not change.

Fixtures rather than a live API because CI has no credential and no egress, and
recorded rather than invented because an invented fixture encodes what its
author believed the API returns, which is the belief the test was supposed to
be checking.
