"""Slack presentation for a fleet-audit report: a headline, the top findings, the ledger link.

Pure functions only, like :mod:`slack_presenter`. Its caller is
``session_kv_server.relay_cron_report``, which finds the ledger issue the
report ends with (:func:`ledger_ref`), fetches it, and posts
:func:`blocks_from_issue`, or :func:`headline_from_issue` as text where Slack
refuses the blocks, falling back to :func:`headline_fallback` when the fetch or
the parse fails. The caller must fetch only issues in repositories it manages:
:func:`ledger_ref` takes the repository from the report's own URL. A closed
issue, or one not labelled ``agent:audit``, does not parse. A clean
run closes its ledger without rewriting the title, so a closed issue's counts
are the last run's, not this one's; a zero-finding run that could not read the
whole fleet, or did not account for a carried finding, leaves the ledger open
over the same old title, so a finding total in the report's line that
disagrees with the title also falls back, as does a line with no total that
counts nothing non-zero or calls the run clean, held or carried; a report that
is only the link keeps the title. The text goes out through
``hermes send``, and the Slack adapter converts standard markdown to mrkdwn on
the way, so the text here is markdown: ``**bold**`` and ``[label](url)``. That
conversion is also why the text does not call
:func:`slack_presenter.fallback_text`, whose output is mrkdwn already: its
``*headline*`` would reach Slack as italics. The rows are
:func:`slack_presenter.severity_row` in both, which reads the same either way.

The audit SOPs relay one line ending in ``— <issue_url>``. The counts and the
findings come from the issue itself, whose title is fleet-audit's
``issue_title`` (``[audit] <name> — <n> findings (<c> critical)``) and whose
body has one ``### <Severity> (<n>)`` section per severity, most severe first,
each finding a ``#### <title> <!-- finding:<id> -->`` heading; the collector's
held rows under ``## Held by the collector`` are not this run's findings, and
a ``#`` line inside a finding's fenced evidence ends no section.
Nothing in the report's own text can set the counts or pick the link, beyond
its last URL; its line can only withhold them.

The card carries one number, the title's finding count: "<Name> found 7
things to look at across 3 clusters.", the coverage taken from the line's
"across <n> clusters" when it has one. Where the line names something it
could not scan, that goes on a line of its own under the headline ("1 cluster
unreachable.") and the coverage is dropped unless it reads "<n> of <m>",
since "across 3 clusters" would vouch for all three. The line's single "<n>
new" count follows it ("2 are new since the last run."), then the top two
findings and a "Fix the first one" button whose value names the first of
them, a "See all N" button when the issue counts more, and the
ledger link. The relayed line itself is not on the card, so it goes in the
headline's thread (:func:`needs_fold`), where its resolved count and
remediation pull requests stay readable. Finding titles are model-written and editable
on the forge, as is the issue title, and the relayed line is model-written
too, so a row, the audit name and the relayed line keep a link's text and drop
its target, and a ``<!channel>``-style token loses its brackets.
