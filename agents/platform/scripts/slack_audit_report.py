"""Slack presentation for a fleet-audit report: a headline, the top findings, the ledger link.

Pure functions only, like :mod:`slack_presenter`. Its caller is
``session_kv_server.relay_cron_report``, which finds the ledger issue the
report ends with (:func:`ledger_ref`), fetches it, and posts
:func:`blocks_from_issue`, or :func:`headline_from_issue` as text where Slack
refuses the blocks, falling back to :func:`headline_fallback` when the fetch or
the parse fails. The caller must fetch only issues in repositories it manages:
:func:`ledger_ref` takes the repository from the report's own URL. An issue
not labelled ``agent:audit`` does not parse. A clean run closes its ledger
without rewriting the title, so a closed issue's counts are the last run's,
not this one's: a closed ledger is the clean card ("<Name>: clean. Ledger
closed."), unless the report's line counts a finding; a zero-finding run that could not read the
whole fleet, or did not account for a carried finding, leaves the ledger open
over the same old title, so a finding total in the report's line that
disagrees with the title also falls back, as does a line with no total that
counts nothing non-zero or calls the run clean, held or carried; a report that
is only the link keeps the title. The text goes out through
``hermes send``, and the Slack adapter converts standard markdown to mrkdwn on
the way, so the text here is markdown: ``**bold**`` and ``[label](url)``. That
conversion is also why the text does not call
:func:`slack_presenter.fallback_text`, whose output is mrkdwn already: its
``*headline*`` would reach Slack as italics. The rows are
:func:`slack_presenter.severity_row` in both, which reads the same either way.

The audit SOPs relay one line ending in ``— <issue_url>``. The counts and the
findings come from the issue itself, whose title is fleet-audit's
``issue_title`` (``[audit] <name> — <n> findings (<c> critical)``) and whose
body has one ``### <Severity> (<n>)`` section per severity, most severe first,
each finding a ``#### <title> <!-- finding:<id> -->`` heading, with a
``<!-- finding-new -->`` line under it when the run measured it as new since
the last; the collector's held rows under ``## Held by the collector`` are not
this run's findings, and a ``#`` line inside a finding's fenced evidence ends
no section.
Nothing in the report's own text can set the counts or pick the link, beyond
its last URL; its line can only withhold them.

The headline carries one number, the count of the most severe findings
present: "<Name>: 2 critical findings", the name as the title writes it.
Up to ``CRITICAL_ROWS_MAX`` critical findings are listed under it, or the top two of a lower
severity when there is none, a new one tagged "· _new_"; the body's summary
line ("7 findings: 2 critical, 1 major, 4 minor.") counts the rest by severity
("5 more (1 major, 4 minor) are in the ledger issue."). The clusters the
body's Scope section skipped get a line of their own ("Couldn't reach
seeded-c, so this run didn't check it." when every reason says it was
unreachable, "Didn't check seeded-c this run." otherwise), counted past three
names, or the line's own words for what it could not scan when the body has
no such table. Then a "Look at the first one" button and the ledger link. The
relayed line itself is not on the card, and nothing posts it under the card
either: the card links the ledger issue, which holds the rest. Finding titles
are model-written and editable
on the forge, as is the issue title, and the relayed line is model-written
too, so a row, the audit name and the relayed line keep a link's text and drop
its target, and a ``<!channel>``-style token loses its brackets.
