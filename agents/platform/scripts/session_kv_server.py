    KEPT AS A BACKSTOP, no longer load-bearing. The disagreement it was written
    for is fixed at its source in #786: the operator now pins `API_SERVER_KEY`
    in the managed `.env` (`renderManagedEnv` in
    `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go`), which
    `load_hermes_dotenv` applies LAST with `override=True` — after the PVC file
    — so `os.environ["API_SERVER_KEY"]` and this function now return the same
    value on an operator-managed pod, and the fallback below is what runs.

    What went wrong, because the shape recurs. The operator sets that name to
    the non-secret loopback sentinel `cluster-internal-trusted`, on the premise
    that the listener is loopback-only and the credential-proxy sidecar
    authenticates outside callers against `API_SERVER_EXTERNAL_KEY`. Hermes did
    not honour that premise from this side: `$HERMES_HOME/.env` is loaded over
    the process environment, deliberately, so that a key rotation in that file
    is not shadowed by a stale export — and Hermes' Docker stage2 hook writes a
    freshly generated strong key into that file whenever it does not already
    carry one. The sentinel was therefore overridden on every boot by a value
    nothing else in the system had ever seen, and every caller that trusted the
    environment got 401.

    Measured on kage-management 2026-08-18: seven consecutive
    `github-repo-watcher` relay turns rejected in one pod's first two hours,
    each degrading to an unrelayed raw report that the scheduler still recorded
    as delivered.

    An earlier note here said that writing the sentinel into `.env` to force
    agreement was tried and made the API server decline to bind. That was
    confounded — the pod had lost its credential-proxy sidecar in the same
    window. Hermes' actual constraint is `has_usable_secret(min_length=16)` in
    `gateway/platforms/api_server.py`'s startup guard, and the 24-character
    sentinel clears it. The managed `.env` pin does not touch that file at all
    in any case; it wins by being applied after it.

    The order below MIRRORS `hermes_cli/env_loader.py`, and reproducing it is
    the point — a resolver that guesses differently from the server it is
    guessing about is worse than no resolver, because it fails while looking
    right. Managed `.env` beats PVC `.env` beats the process environment,
    because that is the order `load_hermes_dotenv` applies them in, each with
    `override=True`. Reading the PVC file first — this function's original
    shape, correct before the pin — would now return stage2's generated key on
    exactly the pods the pin has already fixed.

    Read per call rather than cached at import: `.env` is rewritten a few
    seconds *after* this process starts, so an import-time read would return the
    last boot's key on a deployment that still has the disagreement.

# a namespace going down and taking a hundred unrelated pods with it.
#
# Suppression is deliberately invisible in chat. Announcing the ceiling would
# spend a message to say no more messages are coming, which is self-defeating
# when the point is a quieter channel. The trade-off is real and worth naming:
# once the cap bites, a silent channel no longer distinguishes "nothing is
# wrong" from "the budget is spent", so the accounting lives outside chat
# instead. Every suppressed alert is counted per severity in `alert_quota`,
# logged at WARNING with the workload that was dropped, and readable from
# `GET /v1/alert-quota`. Anyone asking "did we miss something today" has an
# answer; they just have to ask.
#
# Severities come from get_severity_details, and every one of them is capped.
# Covering all three means the `.get(severity, 0)` default in
# _claim_alert_quota is reached only by a severity this module cannot produce,
# rather than by a routine one.
#
# Counts are fleet-wide rather than per-cluster, matching the ceiling as
# specified. The trade-off is that one collapsing cluster can exhaust the day's
# budget for the others; `GET /v1/alert-quota` is where that shows up.

# The bucket drift alerts are billed to, which is deliberately not the bucket
# they are labelled with (see DRIFT_SEVERITY_LABEL, which is what the ledger
# records them as). `_claim_alert_quota` keys the `alert_quota` table on the string it is
# handed, so billing drift as "Warning" would spend the event watcher's budget
# -- and the two traffic shapes are not comparable. One `kubectl apply -f
# ./manifests/` touching six objects is six audit entries, six survivors of the
# classifier and six injects, because the detector coalesces nothing; the
# watcher's warnings arrive one incident at a time. Sharing the bucket
# therefore let routine use of the new signal silently cap-drop the deployed
# one for the rest of the UTC day, which is the more expensive of the two
# directions.
#
# The honest cost of splitting them is that the ceilings now add up: a quiet day
# of events plus a drift storm posts more total alerts than the single shared
# budget allowed. That is a bounded rise in chat volume, and it buys back a

# turn it into a `Warning` Pod alert named `default/` for reason `Unknown`. That
# bills the watcher's bucket -- the one DRIFT_QUOTA_KEY exists to stop drift
# spending -- writes a ledger row the daily recap counts as a watcher event, and
# still answers 200, so the producer records it delivered and never retries.
# Silent at both ends, and one `kubectl apply` over six objects is six of them.
#
# The skew is not hypothetical: this script is copied to the shared PVC from the

# producer that requires its kind here fails closed against one.

    `cluster` is recorded because this server is shared: one session KV
    database backs every cluster profile in the pod, which is the same reason
    the daily ceiling is fleet-wide. Without it the recap cannot tell two
    same-named workloads in two clusters apart, and would merge `prod/api` on
    one cluster with `prod/api` on another into a single line.

    Best-effort on purpose. This runs on the path that announces a live
    incident, and a recap that misses a row is a smaller failure than an alert
    that never reaches chat because the bookkeeping raised.

    Returns the row id so the delivery attempt can correct `notified` when the
    post fails, or None when the write itself did not land. `notified=True`
    here is an *intent* — the row is written before anything is sent, because
    the send happens in a background task and a row written afterwards would be
    lost entirely if the process died mid-flight. `mark_delivery_failed` is what
    turns that intent back into an observation.

    `object_uid` is the involved object's UID, stored because `workload` cannot
    substitute for it: `clean_workload_name` strips the replica suffix, so every
    pod of one Deployment shares a `workload`. The recap counts alerts the daily
    ceiling withheld, and a ceiling refusal makes the watcher forget its dedup
    entry — so the same incident writes a row per sighting while N replicas write
    rows that look alike. Only the UID separates those two cases, and it is the
    watcher's own dedup key.

    `message` is truncated to `LEDGER_MESSAGE_MAX_CHARS` on the way in rather
    than on the way out. The reader's 120-character cut is a display choice and
    leaves the row itself unbounded, and the row is what the shared session PVC
    has to hold once a storm is writing one per sighting.

    Three sources, most specific first, resolved **per platform** rather than
    per source — so a file that names one platform cannot silence another that
    only a lower-precedence source knows about. That short circuit is the shape
    of the bug this replaces: one `if` matched, the function returned, and the
    other platform was never considered.

    1. The managed scope, `/etc/hermes/config.yaml`. On an operator-managed pod
       this settles it outright: `renderConfigYAML` writes both
       `platforms.<p>.enabled` keys as explicit booleans on every reconcile, so
       the CR's answer is on disk in the container and there is nothing to
       infer. Reading it is what #1094 means by "stop guessing the platform".
    2. CONFIG_PATH — `/opt/data/config.yaml`, the front door's own writable
       file rather than a named profile's. Authoritative on
       an install that has no operator — a `docker run` off the image, a profile
       configured by hand — and normally silent on a managed pod: Hermes
       overlays the managed scope per leaf inside its own config loader rather
       than merging it onto this file (docker-entrypoint.sh, "The pins do NOT
       come through this file"), so the `platforms` subtree here carries no
       `enabled` key at all. #855 established that; it is read second rather
       than dropped because it is the truth on the installs that do write it.
    3. The environment signals above, for an install neither file describes.

    Never returns an empty list — an install that resolves to nothing gets
    DEFAULT_CHAT_PLATFORM.

    "Enabled" is not "addressable", and the difference costs a run record rather
    than a delivery. The operator renders `<P>_HOME_CHANNEL` with whatever the CR
    holds, which the provisioning template leaves as `""`, so a platform can be
    enabled here with no channel named in the environment. That is not a reason
    to drop it — `hermes send` addressed with a bare platform name resolves the
    channel from Hermes' own config, and `_slack_home_channel` covers the
    `/sethome` case — but when it genuinely cannot be addressed the leg fails,
    the run is still a 200, and the platform is named in the route's
    `undelivered` field. Read that rather than reading `relay`.

    This is the third copy of this question in the tree, and the copies should
    converge rather than a fourth being added: `platform_mcp_server
    .get_enabled_platforms` is still keyed on the absent SLACK_BOT_TOKEN (#735
    is open against it), and `chat_platforms.enabled_chat_platforms` answers it
    for the Cluster Agent reconcile summary (#989).

    Converging on `chat_platforms` is now safe on the sources as well as on the
    ORDER and the per-platform resolution. This paragraph used to warn that it
    was not: #996 read `CONFIG_PATH` then the environment, so re-pointing at it
    would have dropped the managed scope, and on a pod whose CR sets
    `slack.enabled: false` while a stale `SLACK_RELAY_URL` lingers in the
    container environment that is not a refactor but a re-enabled leg an
    operator turned off. #996 carried `_platforms_enabled_in(MANAGED_CONFIG_PATH)`
    across before merging, as that warning asked. The two functions now agree on
    all three sources and their precedence, and both pin the stale-relay-URL case
    (`test_managed_false_beats_a_stale_relay_url` there, `TestEnabledChatPlatforms`
    here). What remains between them is which callers they serve, not what they
    answer.

    session id when the front door files that card, and substitutes them for the
    `api_server` origin the REST gateway would otherwise stamp on the
    subscription. Writing this row is therefore ordered before the agent turn is

def _triage_task_body(payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """The kanban card body the front door files for the failing cluster's agent.

    Written to be copied verbatim rather than summarised, because a paraphrase
    is how the front door turned one instruction into three on 2026-08-17.

    The delivery is `kanban_complete` and nothing else. The card carries a
    subscription pointing at the chat thread the alert was posted in — see
    `deploy/docker/patches/kanban_event_routing.py`, which resolves that thread
    from the routing this module records — so the notifier posts the `result`
    when the card turns terminal. That is why this body asks for the whole
    report in `result` rather than a summary of it: `result` is the message the
    human reads.

    The report template below is a second instruction channel alongside the
    persona, and says "formatted exactly like this" — so it wins any
    disagreement with the Platform Agent's SOUL.md §7 (Incident Triage
    Communication Policy), which governs the same output. Keep the two in step:
    §7 permits exactly the three ``##`` sections this template uses, and a
    fourth labelled block added here silently overrides the policy rather than
    extending it. The template states that shape itself rather than citing the
    section, because the reader is a Cluster Agent, whose persona has no §7 —
    the delegation to that persona is what makes the citation unresolvable for
    the agent being asked to obey it.

    The **Done when** line is the card's acceptance criterion, stated apart from
    the template on purpose. `_build_agent_query` rule 4 keeps triage cards out
    of goal mode; this line is the fallback if one is graded anyway. Hermes's
    `judge_goal` grades the worker's `summary` (falling back to `result`)
    against title + body, so the line asks for the three facts in `summary`
    too: a body that says what done means, answered by a summary that states
    it, can be satisfied where a body that only says what the report looks like
    cannot (#656). It is deliberately not a ``##`` heading, for the
    three-section rule above, and it sits outside the ``## What to do`` → 🔗
    span that the bench delivery contract slices.

    The report ends by inviting the reader to reply ``apply``, and something
    honours it. The agent that acts on such a reply reads the report back from
    the ``incidents`` table through the ``incident_context`` plugin, and the row
    that lookup needs is written by the same delivery that posted the report:
    ``kanban_notifier.store_incident_report`` keys it to the chat thread once
    the notifier has sent it. That was not true between #738 — which replaced
    the egress call in ``platform_mcp_server.send_notification``, the table's
    only writer, with ``kanban_complete`` — and #802, which restored the write
    on the new path. In that window the invitation was withheld here, because a
    reply to it reached the front door as the bare word ``apply`` with no
    report, no options and no cluster. So the bullet is load-bearing on that
    write: if the row stops being written, take the bullet out again rather
    than leaving a promise the system cannot keep.

    A report with one option is not lettered. "Option A" standing alone asks
    the reader to pick from a list of one, so that shape labels the bullet
    **Proposed fix** and stops the call to action at ``apply``. What the letter
    was also doing is evidence: ``kanban_notifier.actionable_report`` decided
    which completions earn an ``incidents`` row by looking for ``Option <A-Z>``
    under ``What to do``, and an unlettered report would have earned none — the
    bare-``apply`` failure below, reintroduced with nothing red. It now takes
    the ``To authorize:`` bullet as that evidence, which is the one line both
    shapes carry. So the label in this template and the pattern in that gate are
    one decision in two files: change the words here and the gate stops
    recognising the report. A third file reads it too —
    bench/tasks/autoops-warning-event-triage/task.yaml's delivery objective
    keys on the same literals — so a reword here has three readers to
    reconcile, not one. ``test_triage_reply_roundtrip.py`` holds this template
    against the gate; bench/tests/test_triage_delivery_contract.py holds it
    against both the gate and that eval case.

    §7 rule 3 — "no offer to help further" — does not reach the bullet. Rule 3
    is about closing chatter, the "let me know if you need anything else" that
    ends a message with nothing in it; rule 1 requires the report to say what
    the agent wants done. The report asks the reader for exactly one decision,
    and the ``To authorize:`` bullet is how that decision is expressed. It is
    the ask, not an offer alongside it.

    The report template below is STANDARD markdown, and must stay that way.
    Every chat platform's adapter translates the agent's markdown on the way
    out; on Slack that is ``SlackAdapter.format_message``, which rewrites
    ``**bold**`` to ``*bold*`` and ``[label](url)`` to ``<url|label>``. Writing
    the template in the destination's own syntax does not skip that pass, it
    feeds it: a pre-authored ``*Issue:*`` matches format_message's single-
    asterisk ITALIC rule and every heading in the delivered report came out
    italic instead of bold. Authoring in markdown also lets the Block Kit
    renderer (``platforms.slack.extra.rich_blocks`` in agents/chat/config.yaml)
    see the structure and emit real header, list and table blocks.

    """The turn sent to the gateway, which is always the Planning Agent's.

    `_create_gateway_session` cannot choose a profile, so the reader is the
    `default` front door: an agent with no cluster access and no chat egress of
    its own, whose one job and one tool is `kanban_create`. Everything here is
    therefore addressed to a router, and the diagnostic brief travels through it
    as an opaque payload between markers rather than as instructions the router
    is meant to act on. The rules are numbered and short because the failure this
    replaces was not a refusal — it was a helpful front door improvising: on
    2026-08-17 it summarised the brief into one card for the Cluster Agent,
    dropped the delivery instruction on the way, filed a second card asking the
    Platform Agent to deliver instead, and leaked a "This is a test notification"
    probe into the user's incident thread from a third.

    Nothing about where the answer goes travels through this text. The card the
    front door files inherits the alert's chat route from the session it is
    filed in, so a paraphrase can cost the report's shape but not its address.

    The fourth rule exists because on 2026-08-12 the front door set
    `goal_mode=true` on its own (card t_0a43cf9c, #656). Nothing asked for it;
    the tool's default is false. A goal-mode card is graded by Hermes's
    `judge_goal` against its title and body before `kanban_complete` is allowed
    through, and this body is a shape rather than a criterion, so the worker's
    only exit once the judge rejected its report was a sticky `needs_input`
    block with `result = NULL`. The rule is stated here, where the router reads
    its instructions, rather than in the persona, because the persona is what
    the router had when it improvised.

    Drift records take `_drift_agent_query` instead. They arrive on the same
    route from a different producer and describe a change a person made, not a

    delivery, the three `##` sections SOUL.md §7 permits, the **Done when**
    line, and the `To authorize:` bullet that `kanban_notifier.actionable_report`
    keys on to decide which completions earn an `incidents` row — which is what

    keys on the same literals — and bench/tests/test_triage_delivery_contract.py

    What is not shared is the question. An event says Kubernetes is unhappy and
    asks for a root cause. This says a person or a tool changed a live object
    outside git, and asks whether the declared state or the live state is the
    one that should win. That is a decision the reader makes, not a defect the
    agent diagnoses, so the report's job is to establish what changed, whether
    it still stands, and what each answer would cost.

    The report goes to every platform :func:`enabled_chat_platforms` names, each
    into its own thread, because "the home channel" on a dual-platform install is
    two channels and picking one silently dropped the other.

    Minus `also_delivered_to`, which is how the fan-out avoids double-posting.
    The relay is one leg of the job's `deliver` value, not the whole of it:
    `deliver: "chat"` is relay-only, but `deliver: "all"` asks the scheduler to
    post the raw report to every home channel *and* routes a leg through here,
    so fanning out unconditionally puts two copies in each channel — the raw one
    from the scheduler and the composed one from here. The caller names the
    platforms the scheduler is handling itself and this function skips them, so
    a channel gets the composed report or the raw one, never both.

    The subtraction only ever removes a strict subset. `also_delivered_to` says
    what the scheduler *intends* to deliver — it is built from which home
    channels resolve in the cron child, and a channel that resolves can still
    fail on the send. Honouring a set that covers every platform would therefore
    trade a duplicate for silence, so where the subtraction would empty the list
    this fans out to all of them instead. Two copies of a report is a nuisance;
    none is a missed audit.

    The set comes from the cron child rather than from this process because only
    the child knows what `deliver` actually resolved to. `all` expands over the
    platforms with a home channel *in that child*, and `home_target_env` rebuilds
    those from the root `config.yaml` — an install whose config carries `slack:
    {}` drops Slack from the expansion silently. Deciding here, from this
    process's environment, would subtract a leg the scheduler never sent and
    leave that channel with nothing at all.

    Returns `(error, degraded, undelivered)`. `error` is None when the report
    reached at least one chat platform, else a short description of what went
    wrong; the caller turns that into a non-2xx and the string ends up in the
    job's `last_delivery_error` — see :func:`submit_cron_report`.

    `undelivered` names the platforms this report did not reach while another one
    did. Delivering to one audience of two is how #1094 lost seven days of
    governance output to a Slack leg that had no home channel and no connection.
    A partial failure is a 200: the report is in a channel and a re-run would
    post it twice to the platform that already has it. It is not silent either —
    the caller puts this list in the response body, from where the relay adapter
    writes it to `last_delivery_error`. Platforms subtracted by
    `also_delivered_to` are not in it: the scheduler is posting there itself, so
    they are skipped rather than missed.

    `degraded` is the half that a boolean-or-nothing return used to swallow. The
    Chat Agent's turn can fail while the send still succeeds, and posting the raw
    report is the right call there — a scheduled finding that reached a real
    problem should not be lost because the front door was busy. But "delivered"
    and "delivered, unrelayed" are not the same outcome, and reporting them
    identically is how seven consecutive `github-repo-watcher` relay failures sat
    unnoticed on kage-management while every run recorded a clean delivery
    (2026-08-18; see :func:`_gateway_api_token` for the cause). So the
    degradation is now said twice: once in the channel, via
    :func:`_unrelayed_notice`, and once in this return value, which the caller
    puts in the response body.

    It is the reason, not a bool: a clause saying what degraded, empty when
    nothing did, so a caller testing it for truth reads exactly as it did when it
    was a bool. The caller returns it as `relay_detail`, which is what saves
    every consumer from hardcoding a sentence about a cause it cannot see. It
    carries the CAUSE and never a platform name — the platforms live in
    `undelivered`, and folding them into both made the two consumers print the
    same fact twice.

    Ordering is deliberate. The turn runs before the send so that what reaches
    chat is the Chat Agent's message rather than a placeholder it later talks
    around; the routing registration and the incident store happen after the
    send because both need the thread the send resolves. If the turn fails the
    report is posted unrelayed — a scheduled finding that reached a real problem
    should not be lost because the front door was busy.
