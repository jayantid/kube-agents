"""Which Google Cloud REST reads the credential proxy relays for the sandbox.

The broker's `/v1/gcp/<host>/<path>?<query>` route forwards a `GET` from the
shell sandbox to a Google API on the broker's own credential. This module is
the whole of what decides whether it may: an allowlist of (host, method, path
shape) entries, in the style of `command_policy.GCLOUD_READ_COMMANDS`, reviewed
as a diff and widened only by pull request. `docs/designs/gcp-api-relay.md`
argues the shape; the security section there is written against the order
`evaluate` answers in below, so do not reorder its checks without reading it.

**The table is the enforcement.** The token the broker forwards carries the
`cloud-platform` scope because the GKE metadata server ignores a narrower
request (verified on a live install, recorded in the design), so nothing under
this module bounds what a mistaken entry would read. A new `ApiRoute` is held
to the bar a new `gcloud` read is held to: one line, one reason in a comment,
and tests that hold the door one word away.

Standard library only, like `command_policy`: this is imported by the process
holding the credential and by its tests, and neither may need a package to do
so. `Decision` is reused from `command_policy` so the handler's refusal body is
built the same way for both doors.
