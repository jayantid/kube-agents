# cluster_agent_reconcile.py - Reconcile Cluster Agent profiles with the live GKE fleet.
#
# Cluster Agents are Hermes profiles on the data PVC ($HERMES_HOME/profiles/<name>), one per
# managed GKE cluster, each stamped with a `cluster_identity` block in its config.yaml.
#
# Policy: **every cluster in every project in scope gets a Cluster Agent profile**, including
# the management cluster where kube-agents itself runs. The scope is the management project
# alone unless the PlatformAgent declares `spec.scope` (docs/designs/multi-project-scope.md),
# which the operator renders to the file KUBEAGENTS_SCOPE_FILE names: explicit projects,
# folders and organisations (resolved through Cloud Asset Inventory), Shared VPC hosts and
# Metrics Scopes (each resolved to the projects it reaches, which then list their own
# clusters) to add, project IDs or
# globs to drop, and single clusters (by project, location and name) to leave unmanaged. RECONCILE_EXCLUDE, a bare-name list matched across every project, keeps
# working for one release alongside `exclude.clusters`. Per run this deterministic engine:
#   • CREATE — scaffolds a profile for every cluster in scope that doesn't have one yet;
#   • PRUNE  — deletes a profile whose cluster is *definitively* gone (a NotFound/404 from
#     `gcloud container clusters describe`), whose cluster is excluded (a triple in
#     `spec.scope.exclude.clusters`, or a bare name in RECONCILE_EXCLUDE), or whose project the
#     scope has dropped, under the three conditions `reconcile()` states. Any other error path
#     — auth, network, timeout, quota, an unreadable identity — is treated as "unknown" and
#     the profile is left untouched: we never delete on ambiguity.
#
# The management cluster used to be excluded, identified via the GKE metadata server. It is
# not any more, because an event on that cluster now needs an agent scoped to it like every
# other cluster's does: the triage session runs on the Planning Agent, whose one instruction is
# to delegate it to the profile scoped to the cluster that raised the event
# (session_kv_server.trigger_agent_troubleshooter), so a cluster without a profile is a
# cluster whose alerts have nobody to answer them. Two consequences worth knowing:
#   • the event watcher must not then watch that cluster twice, once through --in-cluster and
#     once through the new profile — buildWatchSet in cmd/k8s-event-watcher/main.go drops the
#     duplicate;
#   • the management cluster's Cluster Agent can read the harness's own namespace with the pod's
#     GSA — not the KSA, since create_profile pins a get-credentials kubeconfig — so how far that
#     reaches is the GSA's permission set: no Secrets on the default read-only roles, and Secrets
#     included on any `custom` set that names an admin role. `spec.scope.exclude.clusters` is
#     the opt-out (RECONCILE_EXCLUDE for one more release), and the security reference is the
#     canonical statement.
#
# It runs as a `no_agent` cron job on the `default`/chat profile's roster
# (agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json), not the Platform Agent's: it belongs to no one profile,
# and that store is the one the gateway's own ticker thread ticks directly. Scripts and the
# profiles PVC are shared pod-wide, so it operates on every profile regardless of which profile
# ticks it — see "This roster is not inert" and "Never put an id on both rosters" in
# agents/platform/cron/README.md for the ticking model and why the id lives on one roster. It is
# resilient (always exit 0 on the cron path) and posts a summary to every configured chat
# platform only when it created or pruned. `--require-create-pass` opts out of that for a caller
# that has to know whether the roster is actually reconciled; the bootstrap scan gate is the only
# one.

    process killed in that window -- the bootstrap gate runs this script under a
    240s timeout, and Python SIGKILLs on expiry -- leaves a home that reads as fully
    managed: CREATE finds its identity tuple and skips the cluster, PRUNE keeps it
    because the cluster still exists, and the half-scaffolded profile survives with
    no credentials for the life of the volume. Treating it as absent re-runs the
    scaffold, which is idempotent.

    The kubeconfig is asked for over the sandbox rather than stat'ed here. With a
    sandbox, ``gcloud container clusters get-credentials`` runs in the shell pod
    and writes to the shell pod's volume, so this pod never sees the file:
    stat'ing it locally reports every profile incomplete on every tick, which
    re-scaffolds the whole fleet hourly and re-fetches a credential for each.
    ``kubeconfig_landed`` asks the side that has it -- the same way create_profile
    confirmed the fetch -- and answers "not landed" when the sandbox cannot be
    reached, which is the case a recreated sandbox volume actually needs.
