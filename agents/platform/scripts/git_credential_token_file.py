"""A git credential helper that answers with a token read from a file.

    git -c credential.https://<host>.helper='<this> <token-file> <username>' ...

What `providers.StaticFileCredential.git_config` points git at, for the git
invocations the broker makes on behalf of a forge whose credential is a
long-lived token in a mounted Secret. Git runs it with `get`, `store` or
`erase` appended and the request on stdin; only `get` answers. The file is read
on each call, so a rotated Secret is the next clone's credential.

The token is written to stdout for git and nowhere else -- not to stderr, not
to a log -- and it is never in argv: the arguments are the file's path and the
username, both checked by the credential before git is handed them.

Exits 0 with no output when the file is missing or empty, which git reads as
"this helper has nothing", and the clone fails on its own authentication error
rather than on a traceback from here.
