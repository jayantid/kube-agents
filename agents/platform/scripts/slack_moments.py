"""Slack layout for the two moments that get a message of their own.

Pure functions only, like ``slack_presenter``, whose layout this reuses.
``gateway/slack_ux_moments.py`` decides when to post them.

* A pull request the work opened (:func:`pr_opened`): a bold headline naming
  the PR, the worker's own line below it as evidence, and "Open PR" (the
  primary button) and "Files changed" url buttons, beside a green side bar
  (:data:`PR_SIDE_BAR`). :func:`opened_pr` finds it in a progress note or a report, and
  only where the line says it opened that PR, the verb in front of the url
  with the worker as its subject by the one rule in :func:`_ours`, so a note
  citing someone else's PR ("… pull/300, opened by bob", "Dependabot opened
  …", "`dependabot[bot]` opened …") is not announced as ours.
* A question the work is waiting on (:func:`needs_you`): the worker's question
  in bold (plain, when bold would cost it a ``*`` or a ``__name__``), the rest
  of its reason below it, a choice button for each option
  the reason ends with, and a "waiting on you" line. A click is the clicker's
  answer in the thread (``gateway/slack_ux_clicks.py``), the same path as
  typing it. The options are buttons only when there are two to five, each
  fits on a button, they end the reason, and the line right before them is a
  question that is not a yes/no ask to go on ("Shall I proceed?", whose list is
  the plan); otherwise, and with no thread for a click to answer in, the
  question is text only and a typed reply is the answer. Beside it is a yellow
  side bar (:data:`NEEDS_YOU_SIDE_BAR`), which stays once it is settled while
  anything is left below the headline.

Both lay out as one block list; ``slack_presenter.with_side_bar`` splits it
into the headline and the attachment that carries the bar when it is posted.
