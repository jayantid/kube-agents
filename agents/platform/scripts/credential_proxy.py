# default is for a broker run outside the operator. `CommandExecutor.request_slot`

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Who is calling
#
# For as long as the broker ran as a sidecar, nothing on this path
# authenticated anything.  What kept the credentials safe was geometry: Envoy
# bound 127.0.0.1, so only the Pod could reach it, and the socket behind Envoy
# was 0600 in an emptyDir that only this container mounted.  Both of those
# properties are properties of *sharing a network namespace*, and both
# evaporate the moment the broker becomes its own Pod.  So a split needs an
# answer to "who is calling", and this is it.
#
# The answer is a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token, projected into the caller
# with a dedicated audience, presented as a bearer token, and verified here
# with a TokenReview against the API server.  Three reasons for that shape
# rather than mTLS or a Unix socket per caller:
#
#   * It needs no PKI.  This repository has no cert-manager for workloads, no
#     service mesh and no SPIFFE; mTLS would mean standing all of that up, or
#     minting certificates in the operator, before a single request could be
#     authenticated.  The projected token already exists in the cluster.
#   * It needs no Envoy filter.  The Envoy config is baked into the image and
#     loaded by absolute path, so an ext_authz or JWT filter is an image
#     rebuild that cannot vary per agent.  A bearer header rides through the
#     router filter untouched and is checked here, in code the operator can
#     configure with an environment variable.
#   * It forecloses nothing.  mTLS is a transport underneath this, not a
#     replacement for it: adding a client certificate later leaves the request
#     shape, the handler and this verifier intact, and gives ``Principal`` a
#     second, stronger source for the same field.  gRPC carries bearer
#     credentials in exactly the same ``authorization`` metadata key, so a
#     later move to gRPC ports the identity model verbatim.  What it does
#     foreclose is a Unix socket per caller — but a Unix socket needs a shared
#     filesystem, which is the one thing splitting the Pods takes away.
#
# What it is honestly *not*: encryption.  The token crosses the cluster
# network in cleartext, exactly as the github-token-minter call already does
# (see github_token_refresh.py).  Anyone who can observe pod-to-pod traffic in
# the namespace can replay it until it expires.  mTLS closes that and is not
# done here.  buildCredentialProxyNetworkPolicy narrows who can open the
# connection at all, to the sandbox Pod, the gateway Pod and, when the next
# stack takes Google Chat, the A2A gateway Pod.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFAULT_CREDENTIAL_PROXY_AUDIENCE = "kubeagents-credential-proxy"

# The second audience, and the per-caller split it introduced (the third
# audience below extends it).
#
# The Pods that call this broker cannot be told apart by ``Principal.workload``.
# It is per-ServiceAccount, and every calling ServiceAccount is on
# CREDENTIAL_PROXY_ALLOWED_CALLERS, so knowing which one called says only that
# the caller was one of the Pods entitled to. What *can* separate them is
# the audience their token was projected with: the operator chooses it per Pod,
# and the API server refuses to validate a token against an audience it was not
# minted for. So the gateway's token is minted for the chat audience and the
# sandbox's for the audience above, and the routes each may reach follow from
# whichever one the TokenReview echoed back.
#
# The split is real rather than notional because the two callers already need
# disjoint routes and the operator already gives each only what its side needs:
# the gateway has GOOGLE_CHAT_RELAY_URL and SLACK_RELAY_URL and an empty
# CREDENTIAL_PROXY_URL, and the sandbox has the reverse. What was missing was
# anything on this side that refused when a caller reached across.
#
# Enforced here rather than by splitting the listener across two ports and
# letting the NetworkPolicy sort them out, for one reason:
# buildCredentialProxyNetworkPolicy is inert on a cluster whose CNI does not
# implement NetworkPolicy, and the API server's TokenReview is not. A port

    """Who the broker believes is on the other end of a request.

    ``workload`` is what the transport can prove today: the Kubernetes identity
    of the ServiceAccount whose projected token authenticated the connection.

    Read that literally — it is **per-ServiceAccount**, and weaker than
    per-Pod. The agent Pod and the broker Pod run as the same ServiceAccount,
    because the Workload Identity IAM binding names it and giving the agent one
    of its own would take the broker's cloud credentials with it. So this field
    excludes every other workload in the cluster and nothing finer: it cannot
    distinguish the agent Pod from the broker Pod, let alone one session inside
    the agent Pod from another. It answers "which ServiceAccount", not "which
    Pod" and not "on whose behalf".

    ``caller`` is where a per-caller identity would go, and it is deliberately
    a field on the object rather than a second parameter threaded through the
    handler. When that model is settled, the agent obtains a capability token
    scoped to one session — *attenuating*, so it can never name more authority
    than the workload token it was exchanged for — and sends it alongside the
    workload token. This class grows one more verification step that populates
    ``caller`` from it, ``authenticate`` keeps its signature, and the policy
    layer downstream reads ``principal.caller`` where it reads
    ``principal.workload`` today. Nothing about the request shape, the
    handler, or the operator's rendering has to change again.
    ``caller`` stays None until then. What must hold in the meantime is that
    neither field is ever derived from the request body — from ``argv``, from
    ``cwd``, from anything a model produced. Both come from a token the API
    server verified.

    ``role`` is the coarse version of that idea which does hold today, and it
    comes from the same place: the audience the API server validated the token
    against, which the operator sets per Pod. It says which *side* is calling —
    the shell or the chat gateway — and that is enough to keep either from
    reaching the other's routes. It is not per-session and does not pretend to
    be. "" means no role was established, which is the ``NullAuthenticator``
    case and reaches every route, because that authenticator is only sound
    behind a Unix socket where the filesystem is the access control.

    ``pod`` is the name of the Pod the token was projected into, from the
    TokenReview's ``user.extra``. It is for the audit line, not for policy: a
    session Pod is one conversation, so it is what traces a brokered command
    back to the conversation that asked for it. "" when the token is not

    The audience is the whole point. A token projected with audience
    ``kubeagents-credential-proxy`` is rejected by every other API-server-aware
    service in the cluster, and the API server refuses to authenticate it here
    unless the audience matches — so a token stolen from the agent cannot be
    replayed against the Kubernetes API, and a token minted for anything else
    cannot be replayed against the broker.

    ``audience_roles`` maps each audience this broker accepts to the caller role
    it confers. The TokenReview asks about all of them at once and the API
    server echoes back only those it actually validated, so the role is read off
    the answer rather than guessed from the request. A projected token carries
    exactly one audience, so exactly one can come back; more than one is a
    disagreement with that assumption rather than a wider grant, and is refused.

    ``session_callers`` binds the session role to its ServiceAccounts in both
    directions, because a pod chooses the audience it projects. A caller named
    there may present only the session audience, so a session pod that
    projected the shell audience does not get the shell role; and when the set
    is non-empty, the session audience is refused to anyone not named in it.
    Empty leaves the audience alone deciding, which is the pre-binding

    """The keyed shorthands buried inside a single-dash cluster, re-dashed.

    pflag accepts a boolean shorthand and a value-taking one in the same token:
    `gh api -iX PUT` is `--include --method PUT`, because `parseSingleShortArg`
    consumes `-i`, sets the remainder as the shorts still to read, and re-enters
    the loop. The splitter above only ever takes the *first* shorthand off, so
    that argv reaches the rules as `-i X ...` -- with the `-X` that
    `github.api-mutation` matches on reduced to a bare letter. The merge went
    through. `gh auth status -at` is the same shape against
    `github.token-disclosure`, and that one returns the installation token to
    the agent.

    So each subsequent letter that a rule keys on is re-emitted with its dash,
    followed by whatever is left of the token, which is where pflag would take
    that shorthand's value from.

    The walk stops at the first non-letter, because a cluster of shorthands is
    letters by definition and everything from a non-letter on is somebody's
    value: without that, `-nkube-system` would emit a `-t` off `system` and a
    `gh auth status` somewhere in the same command would be refused for it.

    Two bounds, because the argv is chosen by the sandbox and the sidecar holds
    every agent's credentials. A keyed flag is emitted **once**, since the rules
    ask whether it is present and a millionth `-a` answers nothing a first one
    did not. And a remainder is emitted **once at most**, at the first
    value-taking shorthand, which is also where pflag stops reading the cluster.
    Emitting a fresh copy of the suffix per keyed letter made this quadratic:
    `["gh", "-" + "a" * 1000000]` fits inside `max_request_bytes`, reaches here
    because `gh` is an allowed executable, and exhausted the container's 2Gi on
    a single request. This walk allocates one slice, at the break.

    """The command as the policy rules should read it.

    Two normalisations, both of which the rules would otherwise get wrong in
    opposite directions.

    Free-text flag values are dropped, so prose the agent wrote is not searched
    for command tokens. Without this the denylist refuses the agent's own pull
    requests -- a false positive that takes the product down rather than an
    attacker.

    Attached shorthand values are split apart. gh, kubectl and gcloud are all
    Cobra/pflag, which accepts a shorthand's value with no separator, so
    `gh api -XPUT repos/o/r/pulls/1/merge` is `-X PUT` and performs the merge
    that `github.api-mutation` exists to refuse -- while matching neither
    branch of it, because there is no whitespace or `=` after `-X`. Splitting
    `-XPUT` into `-X PUT` closes that without the rule having to enumerate
    spellings. `-fmerge_method=squash` becomes `-f merge_method=squash` for the
    same reason.

    Splitting the first shorthand off is deliberately unconditional rather than
    gated on a table of value-taking shorthands: emitting `-A w` for the
    boolean cluster `-Aw` costs nothing, since no rule keys on a bare letter,
    and a table would be one more thing to keep in step with four upstream
    CLIs.

    That reasoning holds for a cluster of booleans and fails for a cluster
    whose *later* member is the one a rule keys on, which is why

# fleet audit was midway through.
#
# A denylist rather than a read-only allowlist, deliberately. The set of verbs
# that can mutate a tree is closed and well known; the set of read verbs is not,
# and a new one silently failing closed would be a worse outcome than the race
# this closes. `config`, `remote` and every read verb are untouched.
#
# `pull`, `submodule` and `sparse-checkout` are here because each one is a
# working-tree write wearing another word: `pull` is `fetch` plus the `merge`
# or `rebase` two lines up, `submodule update` checks out whole directories,
# and `sparse-checkout set` adds and removes files across the entire tree. All
# three were reachable in a clone another agent was midway through.
#
# `clone` and `fetch` were left out at first, on the argument that neither
# writes a working tree it does not own. `fetch` does something worse: it moves
# `origin/*` in whatever clone it is run in, and every lease-holder in this
# product compares against those refs to decide whether its work raced someone
# else's. A foreign fetch makes that comparison agree while the answer is
# wrong. `clone` writes into a destination it does not choose, which can be a
# directory inside another agent's lease. Both are leased today by every caller
# that issues them — `ensure_workspace` writes the marker before it clones, at
# the lease root the clone runs in — so requiring the lease costs nothing and
# closes the two remaining ways one agent reaches another's tree.

    spellings than the executor accepts is a parser differential — the one
    kind of bug this policy layer keeps producing.

    1. `--flag=value`, handled by splitting on the first `=`.
    2. `-Ovalue` and `-iOvalue`, the attached and clustered short forms,
       handled by `_GIT_REFUSED_SHORT` against every letter in the token.
    3. **`--fl`, an abbreviation.** git's *subcommand* options go through
       parse-options, which accepts any unambiguous prefix, so `git rebase
       --exe <cmd>` and `git config --glo alias.zz '!<cmd>'` both run. Both

    An argument is refused when it is a prefix of a refused option, which is
    strictly more conservative than git: git takes a prefix only when it is
    unambiguous among the options that subcommand defines, and this does not
    know the subcommand. Deliberately so — deciding ambiguity here would mean
    reimplementing parse-options and agreeing with it forever. The cost is
    refusing `--g`, `--ex` and the like as literal arguments, which nothing
    sends. Note the direction: `--oneline` is *not* refused, because it is not
    a prefix of anything on the list; only `--o` and `--op` would be.

        encoding. Released when the command exited, the slot would let a caller
        that reads slowly keep its body alive while the next command holds the
        slot, and the number of bodies in memory would be the number of
        callers rather than the cap. The other routes take no slot: the forge
        refresh is a short call to the minter, the content workspace's git is
        serialised by the store's own lock, and the Cloud API relay answers
        from a bounded read of its own. The forge refresh reserves child memory
        without a slot when it will run its helper; the content workspace's git

        reservation to fit the budget (`_fits_budget`), in the same queue and

        COMMAND_SLOT_WAIT_SECONDS raises `CommandSlotUnavailable`; with the
        queue ordered, that is the request that has waited longest, not
        whichever one a semaphore happened to pass over.

        deadline, the broker-wide `timeout_seconds` counted from admission:
        `_execute` caps each command to what is left of it. A vcs verb runs
        several network git commands back to back and a first kubectl on an
        uncached cluster fetches credentials first, and without the shared
        deadline a request's silent worst case would be that many deadlines
        end to end -- longer than the idle time Envoy allows the stream in
        front of the broker, which is sized against this one.

        travels the same way `execute_vcs_git`'s does: into the

        The privileged operation a `BrokeredCredential` names and does not

        decided here, and the helper that does the work is found by the
        provider's own name -- so a second forge that needs a brokered
        credential ships a helper and edits nothing in this file.

        Whether the repository is one this install acts on is settled here too,
        for the reason `_repository_is_permitted` gives: this is the call that
        spends the token, so it is the call that has to ask.

        Where the budget is charged (§2.1): called from inside a vcs request,
        this runs under that request's reservation and takes none. It reads
        the coalesce cache first without the lock, and otherwise waits for the
        lock as long as it takes. Called from the refresh route, which
        holds no slot, it reads the coalesce cache first without the lock --
        the common case for the sandbox `gh` wrapper and the fleet-audit skill,
        which call it before every credentialed step -- and re-raises a failure
        recorded since it arrived. Otherwise it takes the lock first, watched
        like admission: CommandSlotUnavailable once COMMAND_SLOT_WAIT_SECONDS
        have passed since arrival, CallerHungUp when `caller`, the route's
        connection, hangs up. Under the lock it repeats both checks, and only
        then, with the budget on, reserves for the helper it is about to run,
        on the reservation's own clock. So only the caller that runs the helper
        ever holds a reservation; every other refresher waits on the lock
        holding nothing and coalesces on the result. A route holder waiting for
        the budget yields the lock to a vcs verb that needs a refresh: the
        verb's reservation already covers the helper, so it runs it, while the
        route caller waits for the verb to hold the lock, queues behind it, and
        coalesces on its result -- both waits on one bound of
        COMMAND_SLOT_WAIT_SECONDS from the yield, since the budget wait ran on
        its own clock and may have spent the arrival bound. Otherwise the knot would hold until the route
        caller's refusal: the verb waits on the lock, and the holder waits for
        budget the verb holds. It yields once: a caller whose re-check is
        still stale after the yield (the verb refreshed another org, or its
        helper timed out) reserves on what remains of the yield bound and does
        not yield again: a vcs verb that counts itself during that second wait
        holds the budget the wait needs, so the caller steps aside for good,
        told busy, and the verb runs the helper under its own reservation.
        A second route refresher still waits on the lock unreserved. A route caller refused past that bound is told it stepped
        aside, with the seconds it spent since arrival, not the lock-wait
        text. A refresher behind a
        helper that runs past the bound is told busy even though the helper
        lands the token seconds later; the client reports a failed refresh,
        and its next call coalesces on the fresh token.

    Defaults to on, and anything that is not exactly "false" leaves it on. A
    typo in a ConfigMap should not quietly hand an agent write access.

    This switch is deliberately not documented in the customer-facing reference.
    It is global, unscoped and has no expiry: setting it disables the read-only
    posture for every command, every agent and every cluster in the Pod, and
    today there is no impersonation layer underneath to catch what gets through
    (see command_policy's module docstring).

    **On an operator-managed install there is no supported way to set it, by
    design.** The operator reserves the name: a `spec.deployment.env` entry is
    rejected by the validating webhook and dropped by mergeCredentialProxyEnv,
    no ConfigMap carries it, and a hand edit to the generated Deployment is
    reverted on the next reconcile. Whoever can edit the PlatformAgent is
    frequently who the policy is meant to constrain, so the switch is not
    theirs. An earlier version of this docstring offered it as the way to
    "recover from a bad allowlist without waiting on an image build"; that
    route did not exist -- the ConfigMap it named has only ever carried
    policy.json -- and following it during an outage costs an operator a CR
    patch that changes nothing and explains nothing.

    The remedy for a command the allowlist should have permitted is to add it
    to command_policy.KUBECTL_READ_VERBS or GCLOUD_READ_COMMANDS and ship the
    image, which is what the customer-facing reference already tells the
    reader to do (docs/site/.../reference/credential-isolation.md).

    What remains is the process environment, which is how the tests arm and
    disarm the gate and how the proxy behaves when run outside the operator --
    a standalone or local invocation, where the person setting it is the
    person running the process.

        `cd` into — which is precisely the arrangement this replaces. The
        `handle` is a broker-minted opaque token, not a location. That holds for
