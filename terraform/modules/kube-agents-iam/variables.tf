    from. The default below mirrors `read_only_roles` in
    terraform/examples/full-install/main.tf, and
    tests/test_scoped_sa_pool_iam.py compares the two, so the mirror is checked
    rather than merely intended. Set [] to grant nothing and manage roles
    elsewhere. The full-install composition resolves permission_set into an
    explicit list before it calls this module, so on that path this variable is
    always named. See the security-and-iam reference for what each role is for.

    The default was going to depend on scoped_clusters: with a pool the
    per-cluster accounts would carry roles/container.viewer and the agent would
    drop it, keeping roles/container.clusterViewer -- enough to enumerate the
    fleet and run `get-credentials`, not enough to read anything inside a
    cluster. That coupling is suspended, because the pool grants nothing (see
    scoped_pool.tf). It has to come back in the same change that gives a pool
    member authority: narrowing the agent while the pool grants nothing is a
    total outage, and arming the pool while the agent stays wide leaves the
    ceiling the pool exists to remove.

    As of 2026-08-12 these accounts hold no IAM grant. They were scoped by an
    IAM Condition on the cluster's resource.name; that grants nothing for
    Kubernetes object operations, and un-conditioned the same binding is
    project-wide container.viewer. Both are gone. Authority arrives with
    per-cluster RBAC -- see scoped_pool.tf -- and until then the broker runs on
    the ambient credential by default.

    Cardinality is per (project, location, cluster) and not per scope tier.
    project_id is per entry rather than inherited so that a cluster in another
    project is a row in this list rather than a second module.

    Every cluster the agent is expected to read must appear here. One that does
    not is refused by the broker rather than served by a wider credential, which
    is intended -- but it means this list and the live fleet are two things that
    can drift, and the drift shows up as a refusal.

  description = <<-EOT
    The projects beyond project_id whose GKE clusters the Cluster Agent
    reconcile enumerates, mirroring `spec.scope` on the PlatformAgent CR
    (docs/designs/multi-project-scope.md §3). Each project in `projects` gets
    the read roles in `local.scope_roles` (scope.tf): the module's read
    allowlist intersected with project_roles, never project_roles itself.
    `exclude` travels with the declaration so the composition can render the CR
    from one object; it binds nothing here.

    `folders` and `organizations` are numeric Resource Manager container IDs;
    each gets the same allowlist plus roles/cloudasset.viewer, bound on the
    container itself, so every project beneath it (including one created
    later) inherits the grant and the reconcile can search the container's
    asset index for clusters (design §4, §6). An organisation binding is wide:
    the design recommends folders until the scoped service account pool
    grants authority (§9).

    `shared_vpc_hosts` and `metrics_scopes` are project IDs: a Shared VPC host
    project, whose attached service projects are in scope, and the scoping
    project of a Cloud Monitoring Metrics Scope, whose monitored projects are.
    Neither is a Resource Manager container, so nothing is inherited through
    them: each is resolved to its projects at plan time by the
    kube-agents-scope-resolver module, handed in through
    scope_selector_members, and this module binds the same allowlist in every
    one, the scoping project included and roles/compute.viewer alone in a host
    not otherwise in scope, because the reconcile's lookups read them. A project attached or linked after the
    last apply reads `denied` until the next one. An exclude entry that names
    a Shared VPC service project by ID, or a monitored project by the project
    number the Monitoring API returns, keeps it out of the bindings; a
    monitored project excluded by ID keeps its grant, which the reconcile's
    naming call needs before the exclusion can match; a glob is evaluated by
    the reconcile alone.

    Empty, the default, binds nothing and the reconcile lists project_id alone.
