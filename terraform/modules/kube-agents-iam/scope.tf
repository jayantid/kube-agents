# Grants for the projects, folders, organisations, Shared VPC hosts and Metrics
# Scopes `spec.scope` declares beyond the host project.
#
# The scope is the set of GCP projects whose GKE clusters the Cluster Agent
# reconcile enumerates (docs/designs/multi-project-scope.md §3). The reconcile
# reads the declaration from the PlatformAgent CR; this file is the IAM half of
# the same value, so a project named in `scope.projects`, a folder or
# organisation named in `scope.folders` or `scope.organizations`, and every
# project a `scope.shared_vpc_hosts` or `scope.metrics_scopes` entry resolves
# to, is bound before the CR that declares it is written (the composition
# orders the release after this module; ordering, not IAM propagation, which
# the reconcile's first tick may still run ahead of). `exclude` travels in the
# variable because the composition renders the CR from the same object, but it
# binds nothing and revokes nothing: an exclusion is applied by the reconcile
# after resolution, a glob cannot be evaluated here, and a project named in
# `projects` is bound even when an exclude entry removes it from the resolved
# set -- drop it from `projects` instead. The one exception is a project a
# selector resolved to, which has no list to be dropped from: an exclude entry
# that names a Shared VPC service project by ID, or a monitored project by the
# number the Monitoring API returns (applied in the resolver, before naming),
# keeps it out of the bindings, so the operator's only lever over a selector's
# members also withholds the grant. A monitored project excluded by ID keeps
# its grant: the reconcile names every monitored project with the agent's own
# credentials before it can match an ID entry, and without a grant the naming
# fails, the member is reported by number as unnamed, and the scope prune is
# held on every tick.
#
# What a scoped project gets is `local.scope_roles`, never `var.project_roles`
# (design §6). The allowlist below is the read subset of the default project
# role list, intersected with what the caller granted the host project, so a
# `custom` list that carries roles/container.admin at home does not carry
# container.clusters.impersonate into every other project, and a
# quota-consuming role does not consume quota where the agent only reads.
# Widening what the scope carries is an edit to this list, on purpose.
#
# A container (folder or organisation) carries the same allowlist plus
# `roles/cloudasset.viewer`, because the reconcile resolves a container's
# members with one Cloud Asset Inventory search scoped to it (design §4), and
# a container-level binding is inherited by every project beneath, including
# one created tomorrow: that inheritance is what makes onboarding under a
# declared folder zero-touch, and it is also why an organisation is wide (§9).
#
# A Shared VPC host or a Metrics Scope is not a container: IAM cannot be
# granted on a VPC or on a Metrics Scope, so nothing is inherited through
# either and every project they reach needs its own binding (design §6). The
# bindings are Terraform's and Terraform cannot read the runtime snapshot, so
# the selectors are resolved at plan time, with the same three reads the
# reconcile makes each tick (§10 step 3), by the kube-agents-scope-resolver
# module, whose members this module binds; the section below says why the
# resolution is not made here.

# A Shared VPC host or a Metrics Scope is not a container: IAM cannot be

# either and every project they reach needs its own binding (design §6). The
# resolution to projects happens at plan time in the kube-agents-scope-resolver
# module, which the composition calls beside this one and whose `members`
# output is this module's `scope_selector_members` input. Not here, because
# the composition calls this module with a module-level depends_on (the
# Workload Identity pool has to exist before its binding), which defers every
# data source in the module to apply time whenever a target has a planned
# change, and a for_each keyed on a deferred read fails the plan. The
# precondition in main.tf refuses a declared selector that has no entry in
# the input, so a caller that skips the resolver is told so rather than
# getting the host bound and its members not. What the selectors do not have
# is the zero-touch onboarding a container gets: a service project attached,
# or a project added to the scope, after the last apply reads `denied` in
# the snapshot until the next `upgrade.sh` binds it.

  # lookup that resolves the selector, which would otherwise read `denied`
  # every tick and freeze the selector. Only the declared selectors' entries
  # are read, so a stale key in the input binds nothing.
  # An exact exclude entry withholds a Shared VPC service project's grant

  # by number never reached this input.

  # projects (cluster_agent_reconcile.py; design §3), the management project
  # included, in a fixed order -- the management project, scope.projects, the
  # selectors' members, then the containers' -- and a project past the cap
  # reads `over-cap` with nothing created under it. The first three groups are
  # known here at plan time, so a declaration they alone carry past the cap is
  # refused (main.tf) rather than bound, while a selector is declared: the
  # read roles in the members past it would be reach the agent never uses.
  # Without a selector the count is scope.projects and the management project,
  # which the CRD's own list cap bounds and this module admitted before the
  # selectors existed, so a plan that declares none is not refused for it and
  # the reconcile reads a hundred-and-first over-cap as it did. Counted as the
  # reconcile counts, once
  # each and less an exact exclude entry: by ID on both legs (a monitored
  # project excluded by ID keeps its grant but leaves the set, so it leaves the
  # count), and by number on the selector leg as well, where the resolver has
  # already left an excluded number out without naming it. A project both in
  # scope.projects and monitored by a declared Metrics Scope that is excluded
  # by its number alone is therefore
  # counted here although the reconcile, which names it with the explicit
  # grant, drops it: the plan cannot tie a number to an entry without the read
  # the exclusion exists to avoid, so the count is a bound, over by exactly
  # those projects, and the error names the remedy (drop the entry from
  # scope.projects, which the exclusion makes redundant). A glob is the
  # reconcile's alone, so a set only a glob brings under the cap at runtime is
  # refused here and wants its entries named exactly. Containers are not counted: their members
  # are unknown here, they come last in the order, and their binding is one on
  # the container rather than one per member.
