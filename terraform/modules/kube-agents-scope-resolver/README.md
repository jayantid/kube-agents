# Kube-Agents Scope Resolver Module

Resolves the two `spec.scope` selectors that are not Resource Manager containers, a Shared VPC host
(`sharedVpcHosts`) and a Cloud Monitoring Metrics Scope (`metricsScopes`), to the projects they
reach, at plan time, so the [`kube-agents-iam`](../kube-agents-iam/README.md) module can bind the
read roles in each. Nothing is inherited through either, which is why the resolution has to happen
before the bindings are planned ([`docs/designs/multi-project-scope.md`](../../../docs/designs/multi-project-scope.md)
§6, §10 step 3).

## What it reads, and as whom

Three `data "http"` reads, the same the reconcile makes each run: the Compute API's
`getXpnResources` for a host's attached service projects (a project that is not a Shared VPC host
resolves to no members, as it does at runtime); the Monitoring API's `metricsScopes.get` for a
scope's monitored projects, which it names by project number; and Resource Manager v3 to name each
number. Every read carries the google provider's own access token (`data "google_client_config"`),
so it is answered for the identity that applies, impersonation included, and not for gcloud's
active account, and names `quota_project` (the management project) as the consumer project, so the
APIs it uses and the quota it draws are that project's whichever credential type the provider
holds. Those APIs (`cloudresourcemanager` and `monitoring` for a Metrics Scope, `compute` for a Shared VPC
host) are ones the composition enables in the apply that follows the plan, per selector, so
`install.sh` enables the ones the declared selectors read before a first install's apply. A 403 that is not a grant on the project read is reported with its own remedy rather than as
one: an API off in the consumer project with the enable command, and an identity the consumer
project refuses (`USER_PROJECT_DENIED`, a plan-only or narrowly granted credential) with the
`serviceusage.services.use` it needs there, since enabling an API that is on fixes nothing. A read
that fails fails the plan, before anything is applied, with the selector,
the HTTP status and the API's message in the error: the identity needs `compute.projects.get` on a
host, to read the Metrics Scope in its scoping project (`roles/monitoring.metricsScopesViewer` is
the narrowest role) with `monitoring.googleapis.com` enabled there, and
`resourcemanager.projects.get` on each monitored project. A 200 whose body is not the document the
module reads (a JSON object of the documented shape; a list, a string or `null` decode too and are
refused as well) is refused rather than read as an empty selector, since an empty selector on the
next apply is every member's bindings revoked. A selector that resolves to more than 100 projects,
less the members an `exclude_projects` entry names exactly, is refused too. The reconcile lists at
most that many projects of the whole resolved set, the management project included, and reads the
rest `over-cap` with nothing created under them, so a single selector past it cannot fit whatever
else is declared, and refusing it at its read spares the naming reads, one per monitored project;
the cap on the whole set, the management project, `scope.projects` and every selector's members
together, is `kube-agents-iam`'s precondition while a selector is declared, since only that module sees all three. A monitored project the identity cannot name, or whose ID
the scope cannot carry (a legacy domain-scoped ID), is left out by naming its project number in `exclude_projects`, the scope's `exclude.projects`, which the reconcile matches against the number on every row a scope named, so the member leaves the set whether or not a run had named it; that is the only entry of that list this module acts on, and the only exclusion that keeps a monitored project out of the bindings: the reconcile
has to name a monitored project, with the agent's own grant in it, before it can match an ID
entry, so `kube-agents-iam` leaves the grant of a monitored project excluded by ID in place. A service project of a Shared VPC host with such an ID has no number to be excluded by, so it is left out of `members` on its own, listed in `uncarriable_members`, and warned about by a `check` block on every plan, while the host's other service projects are bound as usual; a monitored project the Monitoring API should ever name by such an ID rather than by number takes the same path. IDs and globs are the callers': `kube-agents-iam` withholds the grant of a Shared VPC service
project an entry names by ID, the reconcile evaluates globs.

## Why a module of its own

The full-install composition calls `kube-agents-iam` with a module-level `depends_on` (the Workload
Identity pool has to exist before its binding). A module-level `depends_on` defers every data source
inside the module to apply time whenever a target has a planned change, which is every first
install and every upgrade that enables an API, and a `for_each` keyed on a deferred read fails the
plan as unknown. This module is called with no `depends_on` and no input a managed resource
produces, so its reads happen on every plan. `kube-agents-iam` refuses the plan when a declared
selector has no entry in its `scope_selector_members` input, so a caller that skips this module is
told so rather than getting the host bound and its members not.

## Inputs and output

`shared_vpc_hosts` and `metrics_scopes` are project IDs, with the CRD's pattern; `exclude_projects`
is the scope's exclude list. `members` maps each selector's snapshot name (`sharedVpcHosts/<host>`,
`metricsScopes/<scope>`) to the sorted project IDs it reaches, the shape `kube-agents-iam` takes and
the one the reconcile's `fleet_scope.json` `containers` array can be read beside.

[`lifecycle.sh`](../../examples/full-install/lifecycle.sh) in the full-install composition writes a
gitignored `scope_resolver_lifecycle_override.tf` into this directory for the duration of each
`terraform import`, pinning `data.http.scope_monitored_project` to no instances and the `members`
output to an empty list per declared selector; its unit tests fail on a rename of either, and the
composition's README says why the file exists. The script removes the file again, but one left by a
`lifecycle.sh` killed outright would be merged silently into the next `terraform test` here, where
every assertion on resolved members fails against the pin rather than the module. `make
terraform-test` refuses to run a suite beside such a file and names it; remove the file first.

## Tests

`tests/*.tftest.hcl` plan the module with both providers mocked and every HTTP read overridden, so
no case reaches an API: what each selector resolves to from the documents the APIs answer, which
answers the postconditions refuse (a read the identity cannot make, a document that is not the one
read, a second page, a selector past the per-selector cap), and what an exclude entry or a legacy
ID leaves out. `make terraform-test` runs them, as the `validate` job in `validate.yml` does on every
pull request; `mock_provider` needs Terraform 1.7 or newer, above the floor the module declares for an
install.
