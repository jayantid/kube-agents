# Cloud Logging -> Pub/Sub delivery path for the drift detector.
#
# GKE audit logs cannot be read from the Kubernetes API. The control plane is
# managed, so the API server's audit backend is not ours to configure, and the
# stream surfaces only in Cloud Logging. This module builds the route out of
# Cloud Logging and into a subscription the detector pulls from.
#
# Why this sink filters what it does -- and deliberately does not filter more --
# is recorded at each decision below, next to the code it explains.

locals {
  # Mutating calls against GKE clusters, from the Admin Activity audit log.
  # Cloud Logging ANDs newline-separated expressions.
  #
  # Principals are broadly NOT filtered here. The detector classifies them
  # itself and needs the unfiltered volume visible to measure its own noise
  # profile; filtering in the sink would discard the denominators and make a
  # mistuned automation allowlist impossible to debug. The lease carve-out
  # below is the one deliberate exception.

  # Leader-election and node-heartbeat Leases dominate this stream and carry no
  # drift signal. A Lease is created at runtime by the controller that holds it,
  # never applied from a manifest, so there is no Git-side object for it to
  # diverge from. Measured over a 15-minute window on a two-cluster project,
  # leases.update plus leases.create were 9,558 of 10,000 sampled mutating
  # calls -- 95.6%.
  #
  # That 10,000 is the query's row cap, not the window's true total, so daily
  # figures do not come from it. They come from a separate untruncated count of
  # the surviving stream: 623 non-lease calls per 15 minutes, about 60k/day,
  # against roughly 1.35M/day unfiltered.
  #
  # The exclusion is scoped by principal rather than dropping leases outright,
  # so that a person running `kubectl patch lease` still reaches the detector.
  # That is not GitOps drift (nothing declared it), but it can knock an active
  # controller off its lock, and silently discarding it is hard to defend.
  #
  # Both principal clauses are load-bearing. "^system:" alone leaves the GKE
  # service agent behind: in the same sample container-engine-robot accounted
  # for 287 lease writes, which would have inflated the surviving stream by 65%.
  # Matching any *.iam.gserviceaccount.com covers it and every future service
  # agent that carries the "iam" label. It does not cover the Google-managed
  # accounts, which do not: the Compute Engine default is
  # "<number>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com", and Cloud Build, App
  # Engine and the cloudservices agent use "@cloudbuild.", "@appspot." and
  # "@cloudservices." respectively. Their lease writes therefore survive this
  # exclusion and reach the topic. That costs volume and nothing else -- the
  # detector's own classifier matches the whole ".gserviceaccount.com" domain
  # (gcpServiceAccountSuffix in k8s-operator/cmd/drift-detector/classify.go)
  # and drops them as automation. Widening the suffix here would cut delivered
  # volume; it is left alone deliberately, because changing a sink filter
  # changes what a deployed install receives and belongs in its own change.
  #
  # Kept to a single line on purpose: Cloud Logging treats a newline as an
  # implicit AND, which would break the OR grouping if this were wrapped.
