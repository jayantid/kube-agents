# Drift Audit-Log Pub/Sub Routing Module

Reusable Terraform module for provisioning the GKE audit log → Pub/Sub delivery path the drift detector consumes: the Log Router sink, the drift-audit topic and pull subscription, and the IAM bindings that let the sink publish and the detector subscribe — plus, where `topic_publishers` is set, publisher on the topic for each member it names.

The detector cannot read audit logs from the Kubernetes API. On GKE the control plane is managed, so the API server's audit backend is not the operator's to configure and the stream surfaces only in Cloud Logging — hence a sink rather than an informer.

The sink's writer-identity grant is load-bearing: without `roles/pubsub.publisher` on the topic the sink is silently inert. Log Router raises no error, the topic receives nothing, and from the detector's side that is indistinguishable from "no drift happened."

## What this module does not do

- **It does not create a service account.** `detector_service_account_email` names an existing GSA. The GSA and its Workload Identity binding belong to [`kube-agents-iam`](../kube-agents-iam/), which already creates both; minting one here would produce a second identity for the same workload.
- **It does not enable APIs.** No module in this repository calls `google_project_service` — the root composition does, with `disable_on_destroy = false`, so that destroying one component cannot disable an API the rest of the project depends on.
- **It does not tier principals.** Apart from the lease carve-out below, the sink exports every mutating call regardless of who made it, including the large majority from `system:` controllers. The detector classifies principals itself and needs the unfiltered volume to measure its noise profile; a sink-side tier filter would discard the denominators that make a mistuned automation allowlist debuggable.

## What the sink filter excludes

One category is dropped before publication: **Lease writes by machine identities**, controlled by `exclude_machine_lease_heartbeats` (default `true`).

`coordination.k8s.io` Leases are leader-election and node heartbeats. A Lease is created at runtime by whichever controller holds it, never applied from a manifest, so no Git-side object exists for it to diverge from — it cannot be drift. It is also overwhelmingly the bulk of the stream. Measured over a 15-minute window on a two-cluster project:

|                                   | count | share |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| `leases.update` + `leases.create` | 9,558 | 95.6% |
| Everything else                   | 442   | 4.4%  |

The 10,000 is the query's row cap rather than the window's true total, so it fixes the ratio but not the volume. A separate untruncated count put the surviving stream at 623 calls per 15 minutes — roughly **60k/day, against ~1.35M/day unfiltered**.

The exclusion is scoped by principal rather than dropping Leases outright, so a person running `kubectl patch lease` still reaches the detector. That is not GitOps drift, but it can knock an active controller off its lock, and discarding it silently is hard to defend.

Both principal clauses matter. Matching `^system:` alone leaves the GKE service agent behind — in the same sample `container-engine-robot` made 287 Lease writes, which would have inflated the surviving stream by 65%. The second clause matches any `*.iam.gserviceaccount.com`, covering it and any future service agent that carries the `iam` label. It does not cover the Google-managed accounts, which do not carry it — `<number>-compute@developer.`, `@cloudbuild.`, `@appspot.` and `@cloudservices.` — so their Lease writes survive this exclusion and reach the topic. That costs delivered volume and nothing else: the detector matches the whole `.gserviceaccount.com` domain and drops them as automation. Widening the suffix here would cut volume, and is left for its own change because it alters what a deployed install receives.

Set the variable to `false` to export the unfiltered stream while debugging.

## Prerequisites

The caller must have `pubsub.googleapis.com` and `logging.googleapis.com` enabled on the project. [`full-install`](../../examples/full-install/) enables both when it instantiates this module (`enable_drift_pubsub = true`; `logging.googleapis.com` is unconditional there, and `pubsub.googleapis.com` is enabled whenever any of its Pub/Sub-backed features is on). A standalone caller enables them itself: no module in this repository calls `google_project_service`.

## Usage

```hcl
module "drift_pubsub" {
  source                         = "git::https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents.git//terraform/modules/drift-pubsub?ref=vX.Y.Z"
  project_id                     = "my-gcp-project"
  detector_service_account_email = "kubeagents-platform-gsa@my-gcp-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```

`cluster_names` defaults to empty, which exports every GKE cluster in the project through one sink and leaves the detector to route on `resource.labels.cluster_name`. Set it to narrow the export:

```hcl
  cluster_names = ["platform-agent-host", "prod-us-east4"]
```

The filter matches on the bare cluster name, which is unique within a project and location but not
across locations, so listing `prod` here exports every `prod` in the project. That is the safe
direction — the detector matches on the full `project/location/cluster` triple and reports anything
it cannot reach as `unreachable` rather than reading the wrong cluster — but it does mean a narrowed
`cluster_names` can still carry more traffic than the list suggests.

`subscription_id` is the output to feed the detector's `--subscription` flag, alongside `--project`:

```bash
drift-detector --project my-gcp-project --subscription "$(terraform output -raw subscription_id)"
```

The flag takes either form — this fully-qualified path, or the bare `subscription_name`, which it
qualifies with `--project`. `--project` is required either way, because the detector's credentials
are resolved against it.

`topic_publishers` defaults to empty, which leaves the sink's writer identity as the topic's only
publisher — the shape the section above assumes. Each member listed here takes
`roles/pubsub.publisher` on the topic as well:

```hcl
  topic_publishers = ["serviceAccount:bench-runner@my-gcp-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"]
```

Weigh that against what the detector does with what arrives. It reads
`protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail` out of each record and classifies on it, and
Pub/Sub does not attach the publishing identity to the message, so the detector cannot tell a
record the sink exported from one a listed member composed. Anything that can publish here can
therefore make the detector report a change nobody made, under any principal it chooses. The
intended use is a test harness injecting synthetic audit records on a project set aside for it;
on an install carrying real traffic, leave it empty. Never list the detector's own
`detector_service_account_email` — the agent would be writing the stream its own pod reads.

Lowering `ack_deadline_seconds` below its 60s default means passing the detector a matching
`--batch-join-budget`. The detector holds a whole batch while it reads live objects, and the two
values are not wired together — it reads this one at startup and warns when its budget takes more
than half of it, but it does not adopt it.
[The detector's README](../../../k8s-operator/cmd/drift-detector/README.md) is canonical for what
happens when the budget outlasts the deadline.
