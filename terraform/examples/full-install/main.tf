  # tobool inside the try, not outside: a leaf the type cannot hold ("yes", 1)
  # then fails the lookup and leaves this false, where an uncaught conversion
  # would abort the plan with a type error instead of the message the
  # precondition owes. Such a value reaches the CRD, which rejects it.
  #
  # `== true` inside the try for the same reason, against the one input that
  # is neither a boolean nor a conversion failure: null. tobool(null) does not
  # error -- it converts, and a null of type bool comes back -- so the try has
  # nothing to catch and hands a null to `||`, whose arguments may not be
  # null. The plan then aborts on this local, naming no variable, and it does
  # so whichever way enable_drift_detector is set: OpenTofu evaluates both
  # operands. That leaf is the chart's own idiom, not a typo --
  # charts/kube-agents/values.yaml ships `driftDetector.enabled: null`,
  # values.schema.json types it ["boolean","null"], and the chart README says
  # null is how a knob is omitted so the CRD's default applies -- so an
  # operator copying the block into extra_helm_values to set gitopsManagers,
  # which this composition does not expose, writes exactly that. `null == true`
  # is false rather than null, so the comparison turns the one value the
  # conversion accepts and the operator did not ask for into "not requested".

  # into the computed document and extra_helm_values is the second one, so the
  # provider's later-document-wins merge hands whatever the leaf holds
  # straight to the CR. A null deletes the field -- Helm's coalesce drops a
  # nil user key and the chart's compactFields drops what is then missing --
  # and the CRD's default false applies; a false arrives as false. Either way
  # enable_drift_detector is true in the tfvars, the sink, topic and
  # subscription are provisioned and billing, the CR does not start the
  # detector, and nothing says so. That is the state the two preconditions
  # below already refuse, reached by a third door, and the only one of the
  # three where the operator did ask for the detector.
  #
  # `!= true` rather than a test for null, because false countermands exactly
  # as null does and arrives by the same paste. A leaf the type cannot hold
  # ("yes", "true") is refused here too, which is a better message than the
  # one values.schema.json gives for it further in and arrives before the
  # apply starts. Comparing across types is safe -- a string is not equal to a
  # bool, so it lands on `!= true` rather than raising.
  #
  # can() as well as try(), to tell a leaf that is present and null from one
  # that is absent. Absent is the ordinary case and must not be refused:
  # nothing overrides the computed document and `enabled: true` reaches the
  # CR.
  #
  # The second clause is the same door one level up: `driftDetector = null`
  # reaches the identical end state and the first clause cannot see it, because
  # attribute access on null raises and the can() that tolerates an absent leaf
  # swallows a present null parent with it. Coalesce deletes a nil-valued key
  # where the chart default is a table, and the template's `| default dict`
  # then renders no driftDetector block at all -- no enabled, and no
  # subscription either -- so the ingress bills and nothing reads it.
  #
  # The "absent" sentinel is what separates "the key is there and is null" from
  # "the key is not there": try returns the sentinel in the second case, and a
  # sentinel that is not null cannot collide with the value being tested for. A
  # non-null non-map parent is deliberately not caught here -- coalesce keeps a
