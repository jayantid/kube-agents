    lists them through Cloud Asset Inventory), created in project_id by the
    kube-agents-iam module and keyed on the project id. A project created
    under a declared folder since the last apply gets its account on the next.
    False, the default, provisions no pool and leaves the agent's single
    identity in place, whatever `scope` declares.

    True does two things. It provisions the accounts, and it arms the
    credential broker: the mapping reaches the PlatformAgent CR as
    spec.security.scopedServiceAccountPool with enabled = true, and a request
    naming a cluster in a project with no account -- under a declared folder
    or organisation, or added to the scope since the last apply -- is then
    refused rather than served by a wider credential.

    The default is false because a pool member holds no IAM grant. The IAM
    Condition that scoped it grants nothing for Kubernetes object operations
    (measured 2026-08-12), and un-conditioned the same binding is project-wide
    container.viewer, so both are gone -- see the kube-agents-iam module's
    scoped_pool.tf. An armed pool therefore selects a powerless identity for
    every request and turns every cluster read into a Forbidden. Set this to
    exercise the selection, refusal and minting path; the authority arrives

    allowlist (scope_roles: the read subset of the default project roles,
    intersected with the roles the host project got) in each project, and the
    chart renders the same object into the CR, so the IAM and the declaration
    cannot name different projects, and the bindings exist before the CR that
    declares them is written (the module refuses the plan when the host role
    set carries neither of the two roles that list and get clusters). Ordering
    is not propagation: a first install's one-shot inventory sweep may name a
    scoped project as denied, and the hourly reconcile creates its profiles
    once the grant has propagated.

    Empty, the default, binds nothing and renders a scope block with empty
    lists, which declares that the management project alone is in scope.
    Removing a project from `projects` on a later apply revokes its bindings
    and retires its Cluster Agent profiles over the reconcile's next two clean
    runs. `exclude.projects` takes project IDs or shell-style globs;
    `exclude.clusters` names single clusters by the full triple, because a
    cluster name is unique only within a project and location. Neither
    exclusion changes IAM, except that an `exclude.projects` entry naming a
    Shared VPC service project by ID, or a monitored project by its project
    number, withholds its grant (a monitored project excluded by ID keeps
    it, for the reconcile's naming call); a glob is the reconcile's alone. `folders`
    and `organizations` are numeric Resource
    Manager IDs: each is bound on the container itself with the same allowlist
    plus roles/cloudasset.viewer, so every project beneath it inherits the
    grant and a project created under a declared folder later is discovered
    and readable with no change here; declaring one also enables
    cloudasset.googleapis.com in project_id, which the reconcile's container
    search calls. An organisation binding reaches every project in the
    organisation; the design recommends folders until the scoped service
    account pool grants authority. `shared_vpc_hosts` and `metrics_scopes`
    are project IDs, of a Shared VPC host and of a Metrics Scope's scoping
    project: the module resolves each to the projects it reaches at plan
    time, as the identity Terraform plans with, and binds the allowlist in
    every one (and in each scoping project, and roles/compute.viewer alone in
    a host not otherwise in scope, for the reconcile's lookups),
    because nothing is inherited through either; a project attached or
    linked after the apply reads denied until the next one. A lookup the
    planning identity cannot make fails the plan with the selector named,
    before anything is applied. `max_projects` is spec.scope.maxProjects, the
    most projects the reconcile lists per run (100 by default): the module
    refuses a plan whose explicit projects and selector members exceed it
    (while a selector is declared or the cap is below its default), the
    resolver refuses a single selector past it (and a Shared VPC host past
    500 service projects, one page of the Compute API's answer, whatever the
    cap), and the chart renders it on the CR, all from this one value.

Setting it is not enough on its own: time_sleep reads destroy_duration from state when it is destroyed, because a provider's delete is handed prior state and no configuration, and uninstall.sh runs no apply before the destroy -- so a value raised and taken straight to uninstall.sh waits the 120s already in state and the mail arrives anyway.
