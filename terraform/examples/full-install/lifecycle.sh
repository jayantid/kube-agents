# Makes `apply` and `destroy` repeatable for this composition.
#
# Several things in this stack are not symmetric — applying them is not the
# inverse of destroying them — and every one of them turns the second `terraform
# apply` of a project's life into a failure. Terraform cannot express any of
# them, so they live here rather than in a README telling you to remember them:
#
#   1. Cloud KMS key rings and crypto keys CANNOT be deleted, ever. `terraform
#      destroy` drops them from state and leaves them in the project, so the next
#      apply fails with a 409 — and worse, destroying the crypto key SCHEDULES ITS
#      VERSIONS for destruction, so even an imported key cannot encrypt and the
#      cluster refuses to come back. `destroy` forgets them from state first so
#      Terraform never touches them; `adopt-kms` imports them back and restores
#      any version a bare `terraform destroy` already scheduled.
#   2. The PlatformAgent CR carries a finalizer only the operator can clear, and
#      `terraform destroy` removes the CR and the operator together. The chart's
#      pre-delete hook handles the ordinary case; this deletes the CR up front so
#      the hook is a fast no-op, and force-clears the finalizer if the operator is
#      already gone or wedged.
#   3. A GKE BackupPlan cannot be deleted while it still owns backups.
#   4. The cluster is created with deletion_protection = true, which a destroy
#      cannot override on its own — the attribute has to be applied as false first.
#   5. A Pub/Sub topic or subscription that already exists makes the create 409.
#      Reachable on a FIRST install too: configuring the Chat app in the Cloud
#      console creates the topic before the installer ever runs. `adopt_pubsub`
#      imports whichever of the two is already there before applying.
#   6. The agent GSA (account_id) is ForceNew. A lost agent_service_account_id
#      override in install.env resolves back to the default name and plans a
#      destructive replacement under -auto-approve. `guard_gsa_identity` refuses
#      the apply before Terraform runs. The release namespace is ForceNew the
#      same way; `guard_release_namespace` refuses a move on apply and destroy.
#   7. A state left by an interrupted install can hold the cluster's CMEK
#      entries next to a create_cluster that the retry computes as false, and
#      the module then plans their destruction. `forget_unmanaged_cluster_kms`
#      drops them from state first; adopt_kms brings them back when the state
#      creates a cluster again. `guard_cluster_ownership` refuses the other
#      shape, a create over a cluster that already exists.
#   8. The CMEK key ring and crypto key names are ForceNew as well, and the
#      installer writes them into terraform.tfvars from install.env. A changed
#      or lost GKE_DB_KMS_KEYRING / GKE_DB_KMS_KEY on a Terraform-created
#      cluster plans the key's replacement and schedules the live key's
#      versions for destruction under -auto-approve. `guard_kms_identity`
#      refuses the apply first.
#
# Usage:
#   ./lifecycle.sh apply    [extra terraform args...]
#   ./lifecycle.sh plan     [extra terraform args...]
#   ./lifecycle.sh destroy  [extra terraform args...]
#   ./lifecycle.sh adopt-kms
#
# `plan` reports what an apply would change and touches nothing — no state lock,
# no state bucket creation, no adoption imports. Pass -detailed-exitcode to get
# 0 for "in sync" and 2 for "there are changes".
#
# `plan`, `apply` and `destroy` hide helm_release's `metadata` block, which
# may contain secrets, from Terraform's output; an `apply` that will ask for
# approval at a terminal is left as is, so its prompt shows. A raw
# `terraform` run on this composition prints the block.
#
# Remote state (opt-in): set KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_BUCKET to a GCS bucket name, or
# to "auto" for <project_id>-kube-agents-tfstate. On `apply` and `destroy` the
# bucket is created if missing (versioned, uniform access); `plan` creates
# nothing and fails instead, per its read-only contract above. A gitignored
# backend_override.tf points Terraform at gs://<bucket>/<KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_PREFIX,
# default kube-agents/<cluster_name>>. Unset, state stays local as before.

# calls the provider ("Invalid for_each argument"), with or without a scope
# declared. A second override pins that for_each to an empty set, and pins the
# module's `members` output to an empty member list under each declared
# selector's name: the IAM module keys its scope bindings on that output,
# which the same walk leaves unknown once a Shared VPC host or Metrics Scope
# is declared, and its precondition wants an entry per declared selector, so
# a bare {} would put a "Resource precondition failed" warning on every
# import. Import plans nothing (it refreshes the reads whose keys are known

# A helm_release's `metadata` holds the release's full values as JSON, and the
# helm provider does not mark it sensitive. `values` itself prints as
# "(sensitive value)", but whenever the release changes (every image-tag bump)
# metadata turns "(known after apply)" and Terraform prints its OLD value in
# full -- and on destroy it prints it going to null. Those values can include
# the chart's credentials (credentials.data), so the metadata block is no place
# for a log that anyone else may read, a CI log above all.
#
# So everything Terraform prints for a plan, an apply, or a destroy
# goes through this filter: inside a helm_release, an attribute-style
# `metadata = {` (or `= [`) block is replaced by one line saying it was hidden,
# up to the bracket that closes it at the attribute's own column. The block is
# matched with or without a diff symbol before it: `terraform show`, and a
# plan that imports the release, print it with none. Everything else passes
# through unchanged. Colour codes and a trailing CR are stripped only for
# matching; every line that passes through is printed as received.
# Machine-readable output (`-json`) is not this filter's to parse.
#
# It fails closed: a block whose closing bracket never comes hides the rest of
# the output, and says so at the end, rather than guess where the values stop.
#
# Three properties the callers rely on, each easy to lose:
#
#   exit status  this is the right-hand side of a pipe under `set -o pipefail`,
#                so terraform's own code -- including plan's -detailed-exitcode
#                2 -- is what the pipeline returns.
#   Ctrl-C       SIGINT goes to the whole foreground process group. Terraform
#                traps it and shuts down gracefully, writing state and
#                releasing the lock -- but only if it can still print: with the
#                filter dead, its next write hits a closed pipe and SIGPIPE
#                kills it mid-operation. So the filter ignores INT and TERM and
#                ends, as it always does, when terraform closes the pipe.
#   streaming    output goes out line by line, so a long helm wait does not
#                look hung. fflush() covers gawk and BSD awk; mawk also
#                buffers its INPUT and needs -W interactive, which no other awk
