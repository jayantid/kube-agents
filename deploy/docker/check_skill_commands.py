"""Build-time check that the shell commands shipped skills teach pass Tirith.

A kanban worker runs as ``hermes chat -q``, where Hermes refuses any command
Tirith rates ``block`` or ``warn``, and the refusal is final. A cron run
refuses the same two verdicts through
``deploy/docker/patches/cron_tirith_scan.py``. A command a skill teaches in a
refused form therefore fails every time an agent copies it, and nothing short
of a live run would say so.

This reads every ``bash``, ``sh``, ``shell`` and ``zsh`` fenced block in each
``SKILL.md`` under the skill trees named on the command line, replaces each
``<placeholder>`` with its bare name, and passes the block whole to Hermes' own
``tools.tirith_security.check_command_security``, the call the approval gate
makes on a terminal command of any length. The block is not split into
commands: Tirith parses the shell itself, heredocs and quoting included, and a
hand-written splitter would only approximate it. Tirith has a fixed work budget,
so a block too long for it is refused as ``analysis_incomplete`` whatever it
holds, as a terminal command that long would be; the report prints Tirith's
finding titles so that reads as "split the block". Unlabelled blocks and inline
code are not read: in the skills they hold tool calls, report templates and
program output as often as commands. ``tests/test_skill_inline_commands.py``
checks inline code for the forms the skills used to teach: a variable as the
program, a script path starting with a variable, and a program's path put in
a variable. The Dockerfile names the agent image's three trees; a plugin's
skills ship in its own image and are not read.
A tree with no shell block fails the check, and so do two trees where one path
is, or holds, the other: an empty copy, or a path repeated from another tree in
the Dockerfile, would otherwise pass a tree with nothing read.

Tirith is not in the image, so ``main`` downloads the release ``TIRITH_VERSION``
names into a temporary directory, checks the archive against the digest pinned
here, and points Hermes at that binary. A pod instead installs Tirith's latest
release on first use, so the pin can lag the runtime: a rule a newer release
adds is refused in production before this check sees it. Raising the pin is a
change of its own, with the digests copied from that release's
``checksums.txt``; pinning is what keeps a Tirith release from failing pull
requests that did not touch a skill. Two probe commands with a known verdict
run before and after the scan, and fail-open is off, so a binary that does not
run fails the build rather than passing every block.

A finding that cannot be fixed in the skill text yet goes in
``KNOWN_FINDINGS`` with the rules Tirith cites and its reason, keyed on the
whole block, so an edit anywhere in that block, or a rule a Tirith release adds
to it, brings it back for review. An entry under a tree the run reads that no
longer matches a refused block fails the check too, so the list cannot outlive
what it excuses.

A shell block whose raw text and parsed Markdown disagree, such as a fence left
unclosed inside a list item, fails the check as well: its commands cannot be
read, and ``KNOWN_FINDINGS`` cannot excuse it. The fix is in the Markdown.
