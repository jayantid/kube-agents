"""Wire gateway/kanban_progress_lines.py into the Hermes source tree.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` against ``/opt/hermes``. One locator and
four anchored edits in ``gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py``, one locator
and one anchor for the heartbeat formatter, two anchors in
``tools/kanban_tools_schemas.py``, plus an appended import — with the same
guarantee as the other patches in that file: every anchor must be found
exactly once, every edited file must still parse, and anything else fails the
build loudly rather than shipping an image whose delegated cards went quiet
again.

Where the sites live, as of v2026.9.14. Upstream's September decomposition
(``fd2bfa1893``) moved the notifier's per-tick claim and per-subscription
delivery out of ``gateway/kanban_watchers.py`` into
``gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py``, and turned the per-event
``if kind == …`` chain into an ``_EVENT_FORMATTERS`` table read by
``_KanbanNotification.format_event``. The three edits this patch used to make
inside one loop body are now:

* the ``TERMINAL_KINDS`` filter, module-level in the notifier module (still
  located by name, still asserted to be the terminal-kind filter);
* a ``heartbeat`` entry in the formatter table, backed by a ``_fmt_heartbeat``
  inserted after the last upstream formatter. ``format_event`` treats a
  ``None`` message as "silent kind", which is exactly the behaviour the old
  ``continue`` gave a noteless auto-heartbeat, so no control-flow edit is
  needed any more;
* the one ``adapter.send`` in ``_KanbanNotification._send_event``, routed
  through ``deliver``. The message map is hung off ``self.runner`` — the
  ``GatewayRunner`` — and not off the ``_KanbanNotification``, which upstream
  now constructs afresh for every delivery and which would therefore forget
  the message id between one tick and the next.

The tool schema moved from ``tools/kanban_tools.py`` to
``tools/kanban_tools_schemas.py`` in the same decomposition and is now built
by ``_schema(...)`` / ``_prop(...)`` helpers; the two description anchors
follow it there.

Why the patch exists is documented in the module docstring of
``deploy/docker/patches/kanban_progress_lines.py``. Usage::

    python3 apply_kanban_progress_lines.py [HERMES_ROOT]   # default /opt/hermes

# --- claim heartbeat events ------------------------------------------------
#
# TERMINAL_KINDS is the kind filter the notifier claims events with. Heartbeat
# is not terminal and the name now undersells it, but widening this tuple is
# what puts the events in front of the formatter below; the alternative is a
# second claim path for one kind.
#
# Located rather than spelled out. Upstream owns this tuple's membership and
# adds to it — v2026.8.13 appended "review_requested", v2026.9.14
# "changes_requested" — so a literal anchor on the whole line failed the build
# every time upstream gained a kind, which is churn this patch has no opinion
# about. What it does have an opinion about is that the tuple is still the
# terminal-kind filter, which is what expect_contains asserts.

#: Not the whole tuple: upstream may add to it, and this patch does not care.

# --- the header a progress line carries ------------------------------------
#
# Upstream folds the board tag and the @-mention into ``self.head`` together
# with "Kanban <id>". A progress line has always been the bare
# ``⏳ [board] @assignee note`` — the card id is on the message it rolls up to,
# not on every milestone — so the two halves are kept on the notification as
# well, one line after upstream builds ``head`` from them. ``tag`` is the local
# upstream computes on the line above the anchor.

)

# --- render a note as a chat line ------------------------------------------
#
# A formatter in upstream's table returns ``(msg, wake_handoff, review_detail)``
# and ``format_event`` hands ``msg`` straight back to ``_send_pings``, which
# skips a ``None``. That is the same silent path a kind with no formatter
# takes, so a noteless auto-heartbeat is dropped and the cursor still advances
# past it — what the old ``continue`` did, without editing control flow.
#
# Inserted after the last upstream ``_fmt_*`` def (located by name, so a
# signature change there does not move the insertion) and registered ahead of
# every upstream entry, which is the only position one anchor on the table's
# opening line can give it. Membership is unordered; the position is not
