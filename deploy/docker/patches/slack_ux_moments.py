"""Post the moments a Slack thread should not miss as messages of their own.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/gateway/slack_ux_moments.py``.
``gateway/kanban_progress_lines.py`` calls it for a Slack card when
``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` is on, and ``apply_slack_ux_moments.py`` has every notifier
wake's text pass through :func:`wake_text`, flag on or off. That function does
not read the flag: with it off no question was posted, so the wake text comes
back unchanged. What the messages look like is
``agents/platform/scripts/slack_moments.py``.

Upstream, and why it changes
----------------------------
**A pull request opened.** A worker that opens a PR says so in a progress note
or its report, so the link sits on a plan row or inside the report, where it
reads like any other step. With the flag on, :func:`pr_opened` also posts it
as its own message with "Open PR" and "Files changed" buttons, once per PR per
thread for the life of the process (a restart forgets), since a note and the
report often both carry it.

**A question the work waits on.** A card blocked with ``kind: needs_input``
reaches the thread as "⏸ <head> blocked: <reason>", clipped to 160
characters, and the ``blocked`` wake has the Planning Agent explain it, so
the thread gets the question twice, once as a paraphrase. With the flag on,
:func:`needs_you` instead posts the reason as a question: the first line in
bold (plain if bold would drop a ``*``), the rest below (clipped at 2,000
characters), a choice button per option the question ends with, and "waiting
on you". Buttons need the card's thread, since a click answers in the thread
it was clicked in; a card with no thread keeps its options as text.
The wake still runs, since it is how the Planning Agent learns which card an
answer belongs to, but :func:`wake_text` adds a note that the question is
already posted, so it says nothing now and only takes the answer, typed or
clicked (``gateway/slack_ux_clicks.py``), to the card with ``kanban_comment``
and ``kanban_unblock``. A click's turn names the card, which
:func:`question_card` looks up. Other block kinds keep the line.

When the card moves on, any event of it, :func:`settle_question` takes the
buttons and "waiting on you" off the question, so a typed answer does not
leave them live. A question a click already answered was rewritten by the
click and is left alone; one whose rewrite failed is settled here. The
notifier delivers at least once, so a ``blocked`` event replayed after its
question posted (:func:`asked`) neither settles nor reposts it. A question
whose settle failed when the card asked again is kept and retried with the
card's next settle. The open questions are held in process, so a restart
leaves the buttons of any it forgot.

Fail-soft: a moment that cannot be posted is logged, and the caller falls back
to what it did before.
