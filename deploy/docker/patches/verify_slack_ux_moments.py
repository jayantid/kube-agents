"""Build-time behaviour gate for the KAGE_SLACK_UX moments module.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` against ``/opt/hermes`` once
``gateway/slack_ux_moments.py`` is installed, with ``slack_presenter.py`` and
``slack_moments.py`` staged beside this script (``/opt/defaults/scripts`` is
not populated yet at that point in the build).

Three things are checked:

1. ``gateway/kanban_progress_lines.py`` imports the module, since it is the
   only caller that posts a moment and an import that drifted would read as
   flag off.
2. ``gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py`` passes its wake text through
   ``wake_text`` (``apply_slack_ux_moments.py``).
3. The module, loaded by path and driven with a stub adapter: flag off it is
   inert; flag on, an opened PR posts once with its two url buttons, a PR
   that is only cited posts nothing, and a ``needs_input`` block posts its
   question with a choice per option it ends with while any other block posts
   nothing. The wake for that question's ``blocked`` event carries the note
   and a wake for another event does not; the question loses its buttons when
   settled; and a card with no thread gets the question without buttons.

A refused post raises nothing and logs a warning, so the build is where a
broken layout is caught.
