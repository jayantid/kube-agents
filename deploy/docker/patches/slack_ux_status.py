"""Show a Slack thread's delegated work as one plan, and keep its session status valid.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/gateway/slack_ux_status.py``.
``apply_slack_ux_status.py`` makes the Slack adapter's thread-status setter
and its message-event builder hand over to this module when ``KAGE_SLACK_UX``
is on, and ``gateway/kanban_progress_lines.py`` calls :func:`deliver_row` and
:func:`settle_row` for a Slack card. With the flag off none of those callers
reaches anything here. What the blocks look like is
``agents/platform/scripts/slack_status.py``; this module decides when to post
them.

Upstream, and why it changes
----------------------------
**The session status.** With slack-sdk 3.44 or later, Hermes sends its
thread status to ``agents.sessions.setStatus``: a phrase ("is thinking...")
every 2 seconds while a turn runs, and ``""`` to clear. That method takes
``processing``, ``suspended`` or ``closed`` and nothing else, so every call
fails ``invalid_arguments``, logged at debug: Working… never shows, the clear
never lands, and the refresh loop spends 30 Slack calls a minute on errors.
With the flag on, the phrase becomes ``processing`` and the clear
``closed``, and a status is sent only when it changes, or when
:data:`SESSION_REFRESH_SECONDS` have passed on ``processing``, so a turn
costs a call or two rather than 30 a minute. Each open and close is logged at info. The legacy
``assistant.threads.setStatus``, used when the SDK has no Agent Sessions, takes
free text and is left to upstream.

**The session title.** Upstream titles only DM threads. With the flag on, a
channel thread's first ask (or the question a clicked choice answers, offered by
``slack_ux_clicks`` before its turn runs) becomes its session title, set right after a
``processing`` lands: ``agents.sessions.rename`` refuses a thread with no
session yet. A failed rename keeps the ask for the next ``processing`` sent;
Slack's ``invalid_name`` refusal is logged at warning, once per thread and
title, and any other failure at debug; once the title is set, a follow-up ask in the thread
keeps it. An event alert's thread takes the title the event watcher recorded for it instead
(``slack_ux_incident.alert_title``), ahead of any ask.

**One plan per thread.** ``kanban_progress_lines`` rolls each card's progress
notes into one message per card. With the flag on, a Slack thread instead gets
one message holding a plan with a row per card, edited in place with
``chat.update`` as notes arrive. A progress note creates a card's row; a terminal
event settles it (``complete`` with the card's one-line result, ``error``, or
``pending`` for a card waiting on the user). A card that reaches one of those
without a note gets its row then, already settled, so every card in the thread
shows in the plan; a card this process already put on a plan opens no second
row, so a replayed event or one arriving after its plan was dropped adds
nothing far down the thread. :func:`settle_row` says whether the plan now
shows the card complete, which lets ``kanban_progress_lines`` fold the report
of a card fanned out by another card still open on the thread into its row.
Two kinds upstream never posts
reach the plan through ``kanban_progress_lines.silent_event``:
``unblocked`` sets a waiting row, or one that gave up, running again, and
``archived`` settles a running or waiting row as failed, with an ``Archived``
note. The row stays
rather than the message going: the credential proxy refuses ``chat.delete``,
as it refuses every destructive Slack verb. ``crashed`` and ``timed_out``
leave the row running, since the dispatcher retries the card, and
``block_loop_detected`` sets it waiting, as ``slack_presenter`` reads them.
The plan holds the thread's session status: ``processing`` while a row runs,
``suspended`` while rows wait on the user and none runs, and a Planning Agent
turn ending in the thread does not close it under either. Once no row is
running or waiting, the session is closed and the plan is forgotten here, and
the thread's next card starts a new plan. A plan with a card that gave up,
which the breaker parks until it is unblocked, is set aside instead, as a
lapsed one is below, so the unblock still finds its row. A plan with no note or settled row
for :data:`PLAN_HOLD_SECONDS` is set aside, so a card whose terminal event
was lost does not hold the next card's Working… or put its row on a message
far up the thread; the next note starts a new plan. A set-aside plan holds
nothing running, so its session closes unless one of its cards waits on the
user, which holds ``suspended`` until that card moves: waiting is not a lost
event. Its cards' later events still update their rows on it, and a card
answered there runs on it again: it becomes the thread's plan once more, or,
beside a newer plan, holds ``processing`` for another hold. Past
:data:`LAPSED_PER_THREAD` a thread drops a set-aside plan that is quiet and
has no card waiting first. A set-aside plan with no card waiting on the user
or given up is dropped :data:`SET_ASIDE_MAX_SECONDS` after it was set aside,
or after a card on it resumed, its session sent, so a rolling card or running row whose
terminal event was lost does not keep it for good. A plan evicted at
:data:`PLANS_MAX`, current or set
aside, has its session sent again on the way out, since nothing else would;
the current plan evicted is the thread with the oldest note.
Past ``slack_status.ROWS_MAX`` rows the oldest settled rows leave the plan
first, so the cap hides a live card only when more than that many are live.
The plan has no Stop button yet: ``/stop`` interrupts only the
Planning Agent's turn, and the cards would run on.

Fallback: when posting or editing the plan fails (Slack refuses the blocks, the
message was deleted), the thread drops to the rolling line until every card
that rolled a note since has settled or been archived, which is what the
thread showed before this module. A plan holds ``processing`` while
those cards roll and ``suspended`` while they wait on the user, clearing the
session when its cards settle, even if its initial post was refused by Slack.
A settle still edits a posted plan, best effort, so an edit refused once,
for a rate limit say, does not leave its rows showing as running. Everything
here is in process, like the progress-line map: a gateway restart forgets
the plan, and the next note starts a new one. A
card that settles after a restart opens its row on a new plan, as a card with
no note does, and one whose row this process dropped settles with no plan;
either closes the thread's session, or suspends
it while the card waits on the user, so the Working… the old process set
does not stick; it can also clear Working… for another card from before the
restart that is still running, until that card's next note.
