"""Turn an incident alert into its triage when the report lands.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/gateway/slack_ux_incident.py``.
``apply_slack_ux_incident.py`` makes the kanban notifier hand the terminal
send the adapter :func:`adapter_for` returns. With ``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` off, or
for anything but an incident report bound for its own alert's thread on
Slack, that is the notifier's own adapter, so the delivery is upstream's.

Upstream, and why it changes
----------------------------
The event watcher posts the alert ("🚨 ... Digging down to the root cause")
and the triage card's report arrives as a reply under it, so the channel
keeps showing the alert while the diagnosis sits in the thread. With the flag
on, the report replaces the alert in place instead: the alert message is
edited into the report's "What's wrong" sentence, one button per option, the
links on the report's 🔗 line as link buttons, and the whole report in a
collapsed fold, rendered by the Slack plugin's own ``block_kit.render_blocks``,
the renderer the threaded reply goes through when the adapter sends rich
blocks. The message's ``text`` is the headline, the choices and then the
whole report, because the adapter reads a thread back from ``text`` and
top-level blocks, never a fold's. That holds on a cold read of the thread
only: a session already open on it fetches at most the newer replies, which
skips the edited alert, and a typed ``apply`` there finds the report through
the ``incidents`` row below.

A button's text is ``apply Option B: <title>`` (``apply: <title>`` for the
single-fix shape), so a click, which ``slack_ux_clicks`` sends as the
clicker's message in the thread, is the same reply the report's call to
action asks for. Typing ``apply`` still works: the ``incidents`` row the
notifier stores after the send is keyed to the same thread, and the report
text is untouched, only laid out.

Only the first report in a thread takes the alert. ``POST /v1/incidents``
keeps the first report per thread, and a second one edited over it would
show options the stored row does not have and erase the first from Slack; a
thread that already has a row gets the reply upstream posts. That row is a
best-effort write after the send, so this process also remembers the alerts
it edited and never edits one twice; only a failed write followed by a
gateway restart leaves a thread open to a second edit. A report with no
"What's wrong" sentence, an option named but not parsed, a fold
``block_kit`` cannot render or that would hold a block outside
``FOLD_CHILD_TYPES``, or any failure to edit, also falls back to that reply.
