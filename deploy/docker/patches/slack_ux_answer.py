"""Lead a finished card's answer with its first sentence and fold the rest.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/gateway/slack_ux_answer.py``.
``apply_slack_ux_answer.py`` makes the kanban notifier hand the terminal send
the adapter :func:`adapter_for` returns, inside the one
``slack_ux_incident.adapter_for`` wraps. With ``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` off, or for
anything but a ``completed`` card on Slack, that is the notifier's own
adapter, so the delivery is upstream's.

Upstream, and why it changes
----------------------------
With the flag on, the completion message on Slack is the worker's answer alone
(``kanban_notifier.completion_text``), and the specialists' SOULs have it lead
with the answer (``agents/platform/SOUL.md`` §7, ``agents/cluster/SOUL.md``
step 4). Upstream still posts it as one run of prose, so the answer
sits at the same weight as the reasoning under it. With the flag on, the
message is instead the answer's first sentence in bold, then everything after
it in a collapsed fold titled :data:`FOLD_TITLE`, rendered by the Slack
plugin's own ``block_kit.render_blocks``, the renderer the upstream post goes
through. The message's ``text`` is the whole answer as mrkdwn, as upstream's
is, because the adapter reads a thread back from ``text`` and top-level
blocks, never a fold's.

The first sentence is ``slack_presenter.split_lead``'s, the sentence
``slack_presenter.split_answer`` takes its headline from. A bold headline is
plain text with its code spans kept as code, so an answer it cannot carry whole
keeps the upstream post: one whose first line is a heading, a list item, a
code fence, a quote or a table row, one opening on a bold label, or whose first sentence is longer than ``HEADLINE_MAX``, runs onto
a second line, or holds a link or a mention. So does one with nothing after
that sentence, one whose first line ends in a colon (what it introduces is the
answer), one longer than :data:`FOLD_TEXT_MAX`, a
fold ``block_kit`` cannot render or that would hold a block outside
:data:`FOLD_CHILD_TYPES` (a divider), and an adapter not rendering
``rich_blocks``, since upstream would then post text alone. A refused fold
logs why; a failed post falls back to the upstream send. A closing question posts after
the fold, unfolded, so an offer is never hidden. The folded post
carries what upstream's adds: link-preview settings, ``reply_broadcast``, the
feedback buttons, the status clear and the reply tracking for the thread. An incident report
that edits its alert never reaches this send, and a report a reply can act on
(``kanban_notifier.actionable_report``) keeps the upstream post here whatever it
opens on, so its options are never folded away.
