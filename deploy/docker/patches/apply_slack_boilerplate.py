"""Wire gateway/slack_boilerplate.py into the cron delivery, the heartbeat and the notices.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` against the Hermes tree, after
``slack_boilerplate.py`` has been copied to ``gateway/``. Six files:

``cron/scheduler_delivery.py``: ``_deliver_result`` imports the module beside
its own ``BasePlatformAdapter`` import, and each target's two send lanes take
``cron_delivery_text(...)`` in place of the shared ``cleaned_delivery_content``.
Imported in the function, as that function already imports ``gateway``: a
module-level import would run while ``cron.scheduler`` is still loading.

``gateway/run_turn.py``: the heartbeat's display mode passes through
``long_running_mode``, with the turn's status metadata, straight after it is
read, so the ``off`` check below it sees the result.

``gateway/run_shutdown.py``: ``_send_notice_logged``, which sends both the
shutdown notice and the interrupted-cron-job notice, sends ``notice_text(...)``.

``gateway/run_notifications.py``: the post-restart notice returns before its
send when ``drop_notice`` says so (the ``finally`` still unlinks the marker),
and the home-channel startup loop skips the channel before calling
``_send_home_channel_message``. The helper itself is untouched; the
session-database warnings, which share it, skip a Slack home channel the same
way in their own loop.

``gateway/run_busy.py``: the one-time busy-input onboarding hint is neither
appended nor marked seen when ``drop_notice`` says the busy message came from
Slack.

``plugins/platforms/slack/adapter.py``: ``SlackAdapter.send`` passes its
content through ``system_text`` once the DM target is resolved, the one place
every busy ack, drain refusal, background-task update and provider
authentication failure passes on the way to Slack. Runs after
``apply_slack_ux_reactions.py``, which leaves ``send`` alone.

With the flag off every helper returns its input unchanged, so the calls are
upstream's. What the flag changes, and why, is in the module docstring of
``deploy/docker/patches/slack_boilerplate.py``. Anchors are derived against
v2026.9.14.
