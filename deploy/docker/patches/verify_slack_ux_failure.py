"""Build-time behaviour gate for the KAGE_SLACK_UX failure-reply module.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` against ``/opt/hermes`` once
``gateway/slack_ux_failure.py`` is installed and ``apply_slack_ux_failure.py``
has run, with ``slack_presenter.py`` staged beside this script.

Two things are checked:

1. The five calls are in place, read from the parsed tree as the statement
   right after its upstream anchor, in the same block of the function that
   must make it: ``build_wake_text`` calls ``note_wake`` after the moments
   wake-text line, ``_process_message_background`` calls ``start`` after its
   processing-start hook, ``send_final_ledgered`` calls ``begin`` and then
   sends inside a ``try`` whose ``finally`` calls ``end``,
   ``SlackAdapter._maybe_blocks`` opens by handing upstream's renamed body to
   ``maybe_blocks``, and ``_run_agent_queued_followup`` calls ``drop`` after
   its processing-start hook, each importing the module and reading only
   names bound where it runs (``patchlib.unbound``).
2. The module, loaded by path: flag off a failure wake marks nothing; flag on,
   mock 06's reply to a ``gave_up`` wake's turn is drawn with its first
   sentence in bold and one choice button reading "check it there", a second
   reply in the thread is drawn as upstream draws it, a user's turn starting
   after a wake's claim is never marked, a user message that arrived after the
   mark clears it, and the reply a wake's turn sends under a queued follow-up's
   event or the outer user turn's event keeps the look.
