"""Everything the kanban notifier does with a card's terminal event.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/gateway/kanban_notifier.py`` and
wired into ``gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py`` by
``deploy/docker/patches/apply_kanban_notifier.py``.

One module because it is one code path. When a card reaches a terminal state
the notifier builds a chat line, sends it, and then decides whether to spend a
model turn waking the agent that created the card. Three separate patches used
to rewrite that path — a clip, a result delivery, and a wake filter — each with
its own applier anchored into the same function, each its own way for a
base-image bump to break the build for a reason that has nothing to do with the
other two. They are merged here: one applier, one verifier.

The concerns, in the order the notifier reaches them:

1. **Clip** the status line. ``clip_handoff`` is re-exported from
   ``gateway/kanban_handoff_clip.py``, which stays a module of its own because
   ``tools/cron_run_scope.py`` imports it too and needs it earlier in the
   build. The *wiring* of it into the notifier lives here.
2. **Deliver** the report: :func:`handoff_with_result` puts the card's
   ``result`` into the message the notifier already builds, and
   :func:`unstructured_result` records in the log when that report will render
   flat in Slack for want of Markdown structure. The note changes nothing about
   what is sent — it exists because a flattened report raises no error to see.
3. **Wake**, or not: :func:`wake_kinds_for` decides which terminal kinds are
   worth a model turn now that steps 1 and 2 have made the message carry the
   answer.
4. **Record** what step 3 chose not to announce:
   :func:`note_suppressed_completion` writes a one-shot marker into the
   creator's session state so the *next* turn knows the card finished, without
   spending a turn to find out.
5. **Store** the report the user just read: :func:`store_incident_report` puts
   it in the ``incidents`` table, keyed on the thread it was posted in, so a
   reply of ``apply Option A`` reaches an agent that can see what Option A was
   — or, where the report proposed a single unlettered fix, so that a bare
   ``apply`` reaches one that can see which fix it authorises.
6. **Quiet** it on Slack with ``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` on: :func:`completion_text`
   drops the head line above the report, and :func:`explained_by_wake` tells
   ``kanban_progress_lines`` when a failure line can wait for the wake to
   explain it. :func:`hold_explained` keeps that line, and
   :func:`tell_unexplained` posts it after all if the wake does not happen;
   :func:`drop_superseded` drops it once the card recovers. This step cuts
   across steps 1 and 3 rather than following them.

Step 3 is only defensible because steps 1 and 2 happened, which is the clearest
argument for keeping them together: ``kanban.wake_on_events`` may drop
``completed`` on the grounds that the answer is already in the thread, and it is
this module that put it there. Step 4 is the other half of that bargain — the
answer being in the thread is a fact about the *user's* screen, not about the
agent's transcript, and step 3 is only safe once something has told the agent.
Step 5 is the third: the answer being on the user's screen is what makes them
reply to it, and until the row is written that reply arrives stripped of
everything it refers to.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Delivering the card's ``result`` into the chat that asked for it
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The companion patch ``tools/kanban_result_required.py`` makes sure a card
# closes with its answer in ``result``. That makes the answer *durable* — it is
# on the card and ``kanban_show`` returns it whole. It does not make it
# *arrive*, because nothing upstream posts ``result`` to chat.
#
# The chat line for a completed card is built from ``ev.payload["summary"]``,
# which the kernel writes as (``hermes_cli/kanban_db.py``)::
#
#     ev_summary = (summary if summary is not None else result) or ""
#     ev_summary = ev_summary.strip().splitlines()[0][:400] if ev_summary else ""
#
# One line, 400 characters. The summary channel is therefore not merely the
# wrong place for a report — it is structurally incapable of carrying one. A
# worker that does exactly what the schema now asks (status line in ``summary``,
# the deliverable in ``result``) would still send a chat message announcing a
# catalogue it never shows.
#
# This section supplies the missing text. It goes into **the completion message
# the notifier already builds**, rather than a second message, and that is
# deliberate: the existing send site is wrapped in the notifier's failure
# counter, cursor rewind, and subscription-drop logic
# (``gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py``). One message inherits all of it. A follow-up
# ``adapter.send()`` would sit outside that machinery, after the cursor has
# advanced, and would need its own — a second failure path guarding the payload
# that matters most.
#
# The notifier's own clip gives way
# ---------------------------------
# :func:`handoff_with_result` replaces the notifier's ``handoff`` rather than
# appending to it, and it has to. Where the completion event carries no
# ``summary``, ``kanban_watchers_notifier.py``'s ``_fmt_completed`` builds the
# status line out of the very field this code exists to deliver::
#
#     elif n.task and n.task.result:
#         wake_handoff = _clip_handoff(n.task.result)
#         handoff = f"\n{wake_handoff}"
#
# ``delivered`` is then a 1200-character clip of ``result``, so asking whether
# ``result`` already appears inside it — the containment test
# :func:`result_block` does — is asking whether a report fits inside its own
# prefix. Under ``kanban_handoff_clip.DEFAULT_LIMIT`` it does, and the block
# correctly stays empty. Over it, it never does: the message went out carrying
# the first 1200 characters of the report, the ``[…]`` marker, a blank line,
# and then the same report over again from the top. Measured on a 60-line cron
# catalogue, jobs 1 to 19 arrived twice. Every result long enough to need this
# code at all was delivered doubled, because ``RESULT_LIMIT`` is 30000 precisely
# for reports that outgrow a status line.
#
# Appending cannot fix that — only the caller of the clip can decide the clip
# was a mistake — so the hook returns the finished tail instead. When the status
# line is merely a clipped prefix of the report, it is dropped and the report is
# sent once, whole. That branch got *more* reachable, not less, when
# ``tools/kanban_result_required.py`` began folding a whitespace-only
# ``summary`` to ``None`` to stop ``complete_task`` indexing line zero of a
# blank string and wedging the card.
#
# Length is safe on both platforms this harness ships to. The notifier calls
# ``adapter.send()`` directly, and ``send()`` chunks: the Slack adapter declares
# ``splits_long_messages = True`` with ``MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH = 39000`` and splits
# on code-block boundaries; the bundled ``google_chat`` adapter chunks at 4000.
# ``RESULT_LIMIT`` is well inside the smaller of those headrooms once the status
# line and title are accounted for, and exists to bound a worker that dumps a
# log rather than to fit a single message.

#: How much of ``result`` reaches chat. The status line's own budget is 1200
#: (``kanban_handoff_clip.DEFAULT_LIMIT``) because it is a status line; this is
#: the report and needs room. Sized far above the ~5.5 KB catalogue that card
#: t_8d1cf5cf should have delivered, and far enough below the 39000-character
#: Slack ceiling that the status line, the title, and the clip marker all fit
#: alongside it.
RESULT_LIMIT = 30000

#: Separates the status line from the report. A blank line is enough: the
#: status line is already on its own line under the ``✔ … done — <title>``

# 3. Making the agent wake configurable
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When a card reaches a terminal state the notifier does two separate things
# for the same event:
#
# 1. ``adapter.send(...)`` posts the completion line — the worker's own summary,
#    plus whatever :func:`handoff_with_result` added to it — straight into the
#    originating chat thread. The user has the answer at this point.
# 2. ``adapter.handle_message(...)`` then injects a synthetic ``MessageEvent``
#    to *wake the agent that created the card*, which costs a full model turn.
#
# Upstream hardcodes which event kinds trigger step 2, as ``_WAKE_KINDS`` in
# ``gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py`` (v2026.9.14; it was a local of the
# notifier loop in ``gateway/kanban_watchers.py`` before the September
# decomposition)::
#
#     _WAKE_KINDS = ("completed", "gave_up", "crashed", "timed_out", "blocked",
#                    "review_requested", "changes_requested", "block_loop_detected")
#
# There is no config key for it anywhere in Hermes. For the Chat Agent front
# door that makes ``completed`` pure overhead: the summary has already been
# delivered, so the woken turn re-reads the card with ``kanban_show`` and
# paraphrases a message the user is already looking at. Measured on task
# ``t_c31a1f00`` (2026-08-05): **5.9 s and 32,460 input tokens** for that third
# hop, on a request whose actual work was a single 477 ms ``list_clusters``
# call.
#
# The failure kinds are a different matter. ``gave_up`` / ``crashed`` /
# ``timed_out`` / ``blocked`` produce a terse status line and nothing else, and
# the front door genuinely should react — retry, escalate, or tell the user what
# broke. So this is not "turn the wake off", it is "wake for the events that
# need a decision, not for the one that already answered itself".
#
# The review-flow kinds upstream added afterwards — ``review_requested``,
# ``changes_requested``, ``block_loop_detected`` — are in the default set, so
# an image with the key unset wakes for them exactly as upstream does, and an
# operator's ``wake_on_events`` governs them exactly as it governs the other
# five: listed, they wake; omitted, they do not. What they are not is a
# delivered result. The card is *waiting* on the creator (in ``review``, or in
# ``triage`` after the loop breaker) and nothing has been answered, so section
# 4 — which records a suppressed kind as "already delivered" — never treats one
# of them as such: :data:`UNDELIVERED_OUTCOME_KINDS` is the set it leaves out.
#
# :func:`resolve_wake_kinds` reads ``kanban.wake_on_events`` from config and
# falls back to the upstream tuple, so an image built without that key set
# behaves exactly as upstream does.
#
# All of that reasoning is conditional on step 1 having happened, which is why
# :func:`wake_kinds_for` takes the adapter and leaves a non-push one alone:
# where the notifier skips the send, the wake is not a third hop over a
# delivered answer, it is the only delivery there is.

#: The upstream hardcoded set, and the fallback for any config that does not
#: say otherwise. Also the whitelist: a kind outside this set can never match

    """Return the subset of ``events``' kinds that should wake the creator.

    Mirrors the upstream expression it replaces::

        {ev.kind for ev in d["events"] if ev.kind in _WAKE_KINDS}

    The narrowing has exactly one precondition, and both keyword arguments
    exist to test it: **a text ping carrying the worker's summary has already
    reached this conversation**. The whole argument for dropping ``completed``
    is that ``adapter.send()`` already put the report in the thread, so the
    wake is a third hop over an answer the user is looking at. Where no send
    happened, the wake *is* the delivery, and narrowing it away means a card
    that completes successfully is never announced to anyone.

    There are two ways for that send not to happen, and neither implies the
    other:

    ``adapter``
        A non-push adapter — the API server, whose ``send()`` returns
        ``SendResult(success=False)`` by design — has no channel to ping. The
        notifier skips the send and says so in its own comment: *"the wake
        self-post below IS the delivery"*. Upstream added that self-post to fix
        the api_server wrong-session bug, and dropping ``completed`` re-breaks
        it.

    ``passive_delivered``
        v2026.8.13's ``delivery_mode``. A ``wake``-only subscription suppresses
        the text ping on a *push* adapter too (``send_passive = mode != "wake"``
        in the notifier), so the push path acquired a second way to reach the
        wake with nothing yet delivered. ``adapter`` cannot see this — it is a
        property of the subscription, not of the platform — which is why it is
        a separate argument rather than a refinement of ``_adapter_can_push``.
        Pass the notifier's own ``send_passive``.

    Neither is optional in the notifier. So the config key governs the
    ping-then-wake path only, and on either no-send path the full upstream set
    always applies — including an explicit ``wake_on_events: []``. That key
    means "do not spend a turn re-reading an answer already delivered", which
    is not a thing anyone can be asking for where nothing was delivered.

    :data:`UNDELIVERED_OUTCOME_KINDS` get no special treatment here: a list
    that omits ``review_requested`` does not wake for it on the ping-then-wake
    path, and the no-send paths wake for it as for any default kind. Where
    they differ is section 4, which never records one as a delivered result.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Recording the completion the wake no longer announces
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Section 3 saves a model turn by not waking the creator for ``completed``. The
# saving is real and this section does not give it back. What section 3 did not
# account for is that the wake was doing two jobs at once, and only one of them
# was redundant:
#
# * it *told the user* — redundant, because ``adapter.send()`` already put the
#   whole report in the thread;
# * it *told the agent* — not redundant at all, because the synthetic
#   ``MessageEvent`` was the only thing that ever entered the creator's
#   transcript to say the card had finished.
#
# Dropping the wake dropped both. The creator's session is left with
# ``kanban_create → subscribed: true`` as the last thing it knows, and no event
# of any kind afterwards, so on its next turn the front door does not conclude
# "the card is done" — it concludes "the card is still running", because that
# is what its context says.
#
# Observed end to end on task ``t_a8f58a2a`` (2026-08-08):
#
#   19:08:01  front door files the card, subscribed: true
#   19:09:43  worker completes; 6,191-character report
#   19:09:44  notifier delivers the report to the Slack thread — succeeded
#   19:11:30  user follows up. The front door calls ``kanban_comment`` (not
#             ``kanban_show``) and promises "You'll see the results post here
#             as soon as the agent completes". They had posted 106 s earlier.
#   19:20:59  user asks whether it is still running
#   19:21:12  front door finally calls ``kanban_show``, sees ``done``, pastes
#             the answer it had had all along.
#
# Nine minutes forty-six seconds of dead wait, caused by an absence rather than
# an error — which is why nothing in the logs or the card looked wrong.
#
# The marker, and why it is free
# ------------------------------
# The gateway already has a channel for exactly this: per-turn "must-deliver
# notes". ``GatewayRunner._set_pending_turn_sidecar_notes(session_key, notes)``
# parks strings on ``SessionState.conversation.sidecar_notes``; the next turn's
# agent setup drains them into ``agent._gateway_turn_context_notes``
# (``gateway/run_turn_runner.py``), and ``agent/turn_context.py`` appends them to *that
# turn's user message* through the ``api_content`` sidecar. Upstream uses it for
# the auto-reset notice, the first-contact intro, and Discord voice-channel
# changes.
#
# It is the right channel here for three reasons:
#
# 1. **It costs no turn.** The note is not delivered *to* the model, it is
#    waiting *for* the model, and it rides a user message that was going to be
#    sent anyway. Where the wake cost 5.9 s and 32,460 input tokens (task
#    ``t_c31a1f00``), this costs about seventy tokens on one turn.
# 2. **It is one-shot.** ``_consume_pending_turn_sidecar_notes`` clears the
#    list as it reads it, and ``consume_gateway_turn_context_notes`` clears the
#    agent-side copy again, so a completion is announced to the agent exactly
#    once and never replays out of a cached agent.
# 3. **It rides the user message, not the system prompt.** Upstream moved these
#    notes off the ephemeral system prompt deliberately: a note in the system
#    prompt guarantees a turn-1/turn-2 prompt diff, which forces a full agent
#    rebuild and re-keys the prompt cache. Writing the marker into
#    ``ConversationState.ephemeral_pin`` — the other per-session string that
#    reaches the model — would therefore have cost *more* than the wake it is
#    saving, on top of being a cache slot that the next key miss overwrites.
#
# Not the transcript
# ------------------
# ``session_store.append_to_transcript`` would be durable across a gateway
# restart, which the marker is not. It was rejected anyway: a transcript row is
# replayed on *every* later turn rather than one, it inserts a message with no
# matching assistant turn into a history other code assumes alternates, and it
# is a SQLite write on the notifier's poll loop. Durability is not worth those;
# a marker lost to a restart just restores today's behaviour.
#
# Independent of the subscription
# -------------------------------
# The note has to outlive the thing that triggered it. On a terminal event the
# notifier calls ``self._kanban_unsub(sub, board_slug)`` and the subscription
# row is deleted from the kanban database moments later. The marker never
# touches that row: it lives in the gateway's in-memory
# ``SessionState.conversation`` for a session key resolved from the session
# store. Unsubscribing cannot reach it.
#
# Which completions get one
# -------------------------
# Exactly the ones the narrowing suppressed: the terminal kinds upstream would
# have woken for, minus the ones this delivery is waking for, and never
# :data:`UNDELIVERED_OUTCOME_KINDS`, which have no delivered result for the
# note to describe. A kind that still
# wakes needs no marker (the wake enters the transcript itself), and a gateway
# with ``kanban.wake_on_events`` unset suppresses nothing, so it writes no notes
# and behaves exactly as before. That makes the existing config key the on
# switch and means this section needs no key of its own.

#: Opening of every note this module writes. Doubles as the marker that tells
#: :func:`stage_note` which of a session's staged notes are ours, so trimming
#: to :data:`MAX_NOTES` can never evict upstream's auto-reset notice or
#: first-contact intro.

    already been sent — so "the result is in the thread", which is what the
    note asserts, is true by the time it is written.

    ``wake_configured`` is the subscription's own answer to "should this ever
    wake anybody" — upstream's ``delivery_mode`` gate, ``mode in ("notify+wake",
    "wake")``. It is passed in rather than inferred because ``wake_kinds`` is
    empty in both cases and they mean opposite things: this function's whole
    claim is that *the narrowing* spent no model turn on a completion the
    subscriber wanted woken for, and a ``notify``-only subscriber never wanted
    one. Without the gate every completion on every notify-only card would stage
    a note taking credit for a wake that was never going to happen. Defaults to
    ``True`` so a caller that predates the mode keeps the old behaviour.

    Returns whether a note was staged; the notifier ignores it, but it makes
    the behaviour testable and gives the verifier something that a silent
    no-op cannot fake.

    Fails towards the pre-existing behaviour, loudly. Nothing here is allowed
    to disturb the delivery path: the report reaching the user is the outcome
    that matters and this is an optimisation layered on top of it, so every
    failure degrades to "no marker" — the exact state this code was written to
    improve on — rather than raising into a loop that would rewind the cursor

# 5. Storing the delivered report so a reply to it can be acted on
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# An event-triage report ends in two or three labelled remediation options. The
# reader's next move is to pick one — ``apply Option A`` — and that reply is
# ordinary chat ingress on the front door, a profile with no cluster access, no
# memory of the card, and no idea what Option A was.
#
# The mechanism that closes the gap already exists and works.
# ``agents/platform/plugins/incident_context/`` is a ``pre_gateway_dispatch``
# hook: when a message arrives in a thread it recognises, it prepends the stored
# report to the user's words before the agent sees them. It finds the thread
# with ``GET /v1/incidents/by-thread`` against the ``incidents`` table.
#
# Nothing wrote that table on this path. The rows a triage reply needs came from
# ``platform_mcp_server.send_notification`` — the egress call the card delivery
# in section 2 replaced (#738) — so ``_lookup`` returned ``None``, the reply was
# passed through unrewritten, and the front door received the bare word
# ``apply``. Nothing unsafe followed, because the front door holds no GitOps
# write path and simply cannot act; the report template stopped inviting the
# reply instead, and this section is what lets it be invited again (#802).
#
# Why here
# --------
# This is where the three values the row needs sit together in one place. The
# subscription carries the destination — ``sub["chat_id"]`` and
# ``sub["thread_id"]``, already substituted from the alert's real chat route by
# ``tools/kanban_event_routing.py`` — and ``task.result`` is the text that was
# just posted to it. Anywhere earlier, the address is still the undeliverable
# ``api_server`` one; anywhere later, the subscription row has been deleted.
#
# After the send, which is also where ``relay_cron_report`` puts its own store
# (#731) and for the same reason: "the routing registration and the incident
# store happen after the send because both need the thread the send resolves".
# The notifier's thread is resolved a step earlier — it is the substituted
# ``sub`` address rather than a value the send returns — but the other half of
# that ordering holds identically here. A row written before the post claims a
# reader has a report that has not been sent yet, and on a delivery that then
# fails to send, claims it forever: ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` will not let the next
# report replace it.
#
# Over loopback HTTP rather than SQLite, unlike
# ``session_kv_server._store_incident_report``. That function writes the table
# directly and its docstring says why: it *is* the server that owns the
# database. The notifier runs in the same container — ``docker-entrypoint.sh``
# starts the server in the background and then execs the gateway — but it is a
# different process, so it goes through the same authenticated
# ``POST /v1/incidents`` that ``send_notification`` used.
#
# What goes in the row is the specialist's report, ``task.result``, and not a
# summary of it. The reply this exists to resolve names a letter — ``Option
# B`` — so the stored text has to be the one the reader was looking at when they
# picked it. That is a third answer to a question the table's writers already
# answer two ways: the relay stores the Chat Agent's composed message rather
# than the specialist's finding, and ``send_notification`` stores the
# notification body. Nothing reads a row expecting a particular one of the
# three, and both readers are written for the union — ``incident_context``
# fences whatever it gets as untrusted, and ``list_recent_reports`` returns no
# preview text at all.
#
# Which cards get a row
# ---------------------
# Only the ones carrying something to act on: a ``What to do`` section holding
# either a lettered ``Option`` or the ``To authorize:`` call to action. That is
# not a proxy for "was this event triage" — it is the question itself. The row
# exists so ``apply Option A`` can be resolved, and a card whose result is a
# one-line status has neither an Option A nor anything to authorize.
#
# Two patterns rather than one because the template asks for two shapes. A
# report proposing a single fix does not letter it — a lone "Option A" reads as
# a list of one — so it carries no lettered option at all, and gating on the
# letter alone would deny a row to exactly the reports whose reply is the
# simplest, a bare ``apply``. The ``To authorize:`` bullet is the line both
# shapes end on, and it is the one this row serves: it is the sentence that
# invites the reply the row exists to resolve.
#
# Card metadata cannot answer it. By the time the notifier sees the
# subscription, ``kanban_event_routing`` has rewritten the row to look exactly
# like an ordinary chat card's, and the assignee and title are model-written.
# The artifact is the only reliable evidence, and it is the right evidence.
#
# Getting this wrong is sticky in one direction. ``POST /v1/incidents`` is
# ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` and deliberately keeps the FIRST report per thread — the
# one carrying the options — so a one-line status card stored in a thread that
# later receives a real report would shadow it for the table's whole retention
# window. Storing too little costs one reply; storing too much poisons the
# thread. The gate is set accordingly.
#
# Failing
# -------
# Never fatally: a report delivered and unstored is the behaviour this replaces,
# while an exception raised on the delivery path rewinds the notifier cursor and
# re-posts the report. But never silently either. A silent miss here is the
# same shape as the bug ``kanban_event_routing`` was written for — a board that
# reads healthy while the user gets a blank stare — and that patch settled it by
# logging a warning naming the session on every fall-through. This follows it:
# a report that had options and did not get stored says so, with the card and
# the thread named.

#: The Session KV server's loopback address, spelled as
#: ``platform_mcp_server.py`` and the ``incident_context`` plugin spell it. The
#: server binds 127.0.0.1 only, so this is reachable from the notifier's process
#: and from nowhere off the pod.
SESSION_KV_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8699"

#: Matches the two other callers of this server. The notifier polls every five
#: seconds and this call happens after the report has already been sent, so a
#: slow server must cost the tick a moment, not the next delivery.
INCIDENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 2.0

#: The report's ``What to do`` section, which is where the options live. Written
#: to tolerate the heading depth drifting (``##`` in the template, but §7 only
#: pins the words) while still requiring a heading rather than the phrase in
#: prose.
_WHAT_TO_DO_RE = re.compile(r"^ {0,3}#{1,6} +what to do\b", re.IGNORECASE | re.MULTILINE)

#: A lettered option — the thing ``apply Option A`` names. Case-sensitive on the
#: letter because the template says "Label them 'Option A', 'Option B', ... in
#: order", and a lowercase "option a" in prose is a sentence, not a label.
_OPTION_RE = re.compile(r"\bOption [A-Z]\b")

#: The call to action. The template's single-option shape has no lettered option
#: to match, and this bullet is what it ends on instead — see
#: ``session_kv_server._triage_task_body``, which owns both shapes. The colon is
#: load-bearing and the case is not incidental: this has to match a bullet's
#: label, not the phrase "to authorize the quota increase" in someone's prose,
#: which is a sentence rather than an offer to act on.
#:
#: ``[*_]*`` is what sits between the word and the colon, and it is the whole
#: reason this pattern is not simply ``To authorize:``. The template emits
#: ``**To authorize:**``, with the colon inside the emphasis — but a model
#: reproducing a ``**Label:**`` bullet will as readily close the emphasis first
#: and write ``**To authorize**:``, and italic and ``__``-bold do the same. Those
#: are the same bullet, and matching only the template's exact spelling fails
#: them silently: the single-option shape has no lettered option to fall back on,
#: so the report is delivered, no ``incidents`` row is written, and the ``apply``
#: it invites reaches the front door with nothing attached. That is the #802
#: failure, in the one shape this gate exists to cover.
#:
#: The lookbehind does the job ``\b`` would, and is here because ``\b`` cannot:
#: ``_`` is a word character, so ``\bTo`` finds no boundary in
#: ``__To authorize__:`` and the ``__``-bold spelling fails on the opening
#: marker rather than the closing one.

# 6. Quieter delivery on Slack, behind KAGE_SLACK_UX
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Two lines a Slack thread reads as noise once the answer is in it. The
# completion message opens with ``✔ <head> done — <title>``, a status line
# above the report that repeats the card's title and says nothing the report
# does not. And a failure is told twice: the notifier posts ``✖ … gave up``,
# then the wake has the creator explain the same failure in its own words.
#
# Both are presentation and both are gated on the flag *and* on the Slack
# platform, so Google Chat and a flag-off Slack get exactly upstream's text.
#
# The failure line is held, not dropped. The ping is sent before the wake is
# attempted, so skipping it outright would leave the thread silent whenever the
# wake then raised: upstream counts the skipped ping as delivered and retries
# only the wake, until it drops the subscription. So the line waits on the
# watcher (:func:`hold_explained`), and the notifier's wake step settles it
# (:func:`tell_unexplained`): a wake that was admitted for the kind drops it;
# a wake that raised, or a wake set that turned out not to hold the kind, posts
# it. ``WakeNotAccepted`` (startup, a full queue) keeps it for the retry, which
# rewinds the claim and so replays the same event. An event saying the card
# recovered posting first (its completion, a review handoff, a move to done;
# :func:`drop_superseded`) drops it, so a line held across a
# ``WakeNotAccepted`` tick never lands beneath the recovery. Any other later
# event leaves it held: a wake that then raises still posts it, after that
# event rather than never. Seven trade-offs, accepted:
#
# * A wake that raised and later succeeds on a retry tells the failure twice,
#   once as the line and once in the creator's words. Twice is the safe side.
# * The hold is in-process, like the progress-line map. A restart between the
#   ping and the wake loses it, and the failure goes untold.
# * A push wake is admission, not narration (``gateway/wake.py``). The line is
#   dropped once the wake is queued, so a queued turn lost to a restart or an
#   interrupt before it speaks still leaves the failure untold.
# * A post that fails is tried :data:`TELL_ATTEMPTS` times in place, then
#   dropped with a WARNING naming the card. Holding it again would hand it to
#   whatever delivery the subscription sees next, which can be the card's
#   later completion: a stale failure line under a success.
# * A held line evicted at :data:`HELD_MAX` goes untold, with a WARNING.
# * A subscription dropped before its wake step runs (after
#   ``MAX_SEND_FAILURES`` on a later event in the batch, or by the stale sweep)
#   leaves its held line to that eviction: untold, and unlogged until then.
# * A held line dropped for a recovery, with a WARNING, is told only by the
#   wake after it. If that wake never succeeds the failure goes untold, though
#   the card did recover.
# The flag is read through ``gateway.slack_ux_reactions.enabled()``, imported
# when a delivery runs: that module is copied into the image after this one,
# and an image without it reads as flag off.
