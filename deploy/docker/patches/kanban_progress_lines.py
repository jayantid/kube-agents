"""Mid-run progress lines for the kanban notifier.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/gateway/kanban_progress_lines.py``
and wired into ``gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py`` (the notifier's
``_EVENT_FORMATTERS`` table, ``_KanbanNotification._send_event`` and, for
the flag's silent kinds, the skip loop in ``_send_pings``) by
``deploy/docker/patches/apply_kanban_progress_lines.py``.

**The problem.** A delegated card is silent from the moment it is claimed until
the moment it completes. Measured on the ``kage-management`` board over 298
runs, that silence is a p50 of 264 seconds and a p90 of 1102 seconds. The
plumbing around it costs about a minute; the silence is what makes delegation
feel slower than doing the work in the chat thread. The workaround the personas
used to prescribe — split the work into child cards so each completion posts a
line — buys visibility by paying a fresh dispatch tick, a fresh 17–19 second
worker cold start, and a fresh worker context per stage. It makes the real
number worse to improve the perceived one.

**The unlock.** ``kanban_heartbeat(note=...)`` already writes a ``heartbeat``
event carrying that note (``hermes_cli/kanban_db_dispatch.py``); the notifier
simply does not deliver that kind. Two properties make delivering it nearly
free:

1. The per-tool-call auto-heartbeats fired by ``tools/kanban_tools.py`` write
   ``payload=None``. All 2,107 heartbeat rows on the live board are noteless,
   so "has a note" separates a deliberate progress update from a liveness ping
   exactly — no new event kind and no schema change.
2. ``heartbeat`` is absent from ``_WAKE_KINDS`` in the notifier, so a progress
   line posts straight into the chat thread without waking the creator's agent.
   It costs zero LLM turns, which is why a worker can afford to send several.

``progress_note`` is the whole filter: it returns the note a human should see,
or ``""`` for everything else. The empty return is what keeps the auto-
heartbeats silent, so it is the single most important behaviour here.

Length is capped through ``clip_handoff`` rather than a hard slice, for the
same reason the completion handoff is: a note that ends in a link must not have
that link severed into a dead one. See ``kanban_handoff_clip.py``.

One message per card, not one per note
--------------------------------------
Delivering each note as its own chat message solved the silence and created a
second problem: a five-milestone card is five messages, and Google Chat pings
every member of the space for each of them. Progress is worth *showing* and not
worth *interrupting* for — the completion is the interruption people want.

So :func:`deliver` keeps **one rolling message per card**. The first note posts
normally; every note after it re-renders the accumulated trail into that same
message via ``adapter.edit_message`` (Google Chat ``messages.patch``), which
updates the thread without re-notifying. When the card reaches a terminal state
the rolling message is settled — the ``⏳`` becomes ``✓`` or ``⏹`` — and the
result posts as a message of its own, which is the one that should ping. With
``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` on, a Slack card settles to its last line only, a failure
the creator's wake will explain is held for the wake step rather than posted,
the card recovering drops a failure line it still holds, no line carries the
board tag or ``Kanban <id>``, a card's notes go on its row in the thread's
plan (``gateway/slack_ux_status.py``), the rolling line being the plan's
fallback, an opened pull request and a ``needs_input`` question post as
messages of their own (``gateway/slack_ux_moments.py``), and any later event
takes the buttons off the card's open question; :func:`silent_event` carries
``archived`` and ``unblocked``, which upstream never posts, to the plan and
the question. See :func:`deliver`.

Three properties of the surrounding code make this nearly free:

1. Every notifier line leaves through a single ``adapter.send`` call site, so
   the whole behaviour hangs off one anchor; only the flag's silent kinds need
   a second, in the skip loop.
2. ``BasePlatformAdapter.edit_message`` returns ``SendResult(success=False)``
   on platforms that cannot edit, so the fallback to a fresh message needs no
   capability check and no platform name test. Nothing is gated on
   ``google_chat``.
3. ``send()`` already returns a ``SendResult`` carrying the ``message_id`` the
   next edit needs.

The tracking map is **in-process**, hung off the watcher instance exactly like
``kanban_notify_delivery.high_water``. Two consequences, both accepted:

* A gateway restart mid-card loses the map, so the next note starts a fresh
  rolling message. The trail is split; nothing is lost.
* It assumes a single notifier, which is the same assumption
  ``kanban_notify_delivery.py`` documents at length — the operator renders
  ``replicas: 1`` with ``strategy: Recreate``.

The one thing that is *not* optional is the replay guard. That same module made
delivery at-least-once: a batch of three heartbeats that fails on the third is
re-read and replayed whole on the next tick. Without ``last_event_id`` on the
entry the first two bullets would be appended a second time, so the fix for a
lost message would become a stuttering one.

    Drop-in for the ``await adapter.send(...)`` the notifier used to call, and
    returns what that call site expects: the adapter's ``SendResult``, or
    ``None`` on the suppressed-replay path (the notifier reads
    ``getattr(res, "success", True)``, so ``None`` means "delivered").

    Terminal events are unchanged from the caller's point of view — a new
    message, with the artifact upload and failure accounting that follow it
    untouched. Two things are added on that path, both best-effort: settling
    the rolling message first, and, once the terminal message has posted,
    the ``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` settle reaction on the ask
    (``slack_ux_reactions.settle_delegated``). Neither may reach the notifier's
    ``except``, where a failed cosmetic call would rewind the cursor and count
    against the subscription's send-failure budget.

    That is the flag-off behaviour. With ``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` on and a Slack card,
    the terminal path is quieter in three ways. The rolling message settles to its
    last line rather than the whole trail. And a failure the creator's wake will
    explain is held rather than posted, returning ``None`` like the replay path;
    the notifier's wake step drops it once the wake is admitted for the kind, and
    posts it if the wake raises or never covers the kind, so a failed wake does
    not leave the failure untold. A line that cannot be held is posted. And an
    event saying the card recovered (:func:`_supersedes`) drops a failure line
    it still holds, so the line never posts beneath the recovery. Section 6 of
    ``gateway/kanban_notifier.py`` has the retry and the gaps it leaves. Beyond
    the terminal path, the card's progress goes on its row in the thread's plan rather than in a
    rolling message of its own, with the rolling message as the fallback when
    the plan cannot be posted; ``title`` is the card's, which the row leads with
    in a plan of several or falls back to. See
    ``gateway/slack_ux_status.py``. Every line it posts, holds or edits keeps
    the ``@assignee`` and drops the board tag and ``Kanban <id>``
    (:func:`slack_line`). A card blocked on ``needs_input``
    posts its question instead of the blocked line, once however often the
    notifier replays the event, and loses that question's buttons at its next
    event; a note or report saying a PR was opened is
    followed by that PR as a message of its own. See
    ``gateway/slack_ux_moments.py``.
