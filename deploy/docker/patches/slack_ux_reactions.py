"""React to each Slack ask by kind, and again when the work settles.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/gateway/slack_ux_reactions.py``.
``apply_slack_ux_reactions.py`` makes the Slack adapter's two reaction hooks
(``on_processing_start``, ``on_processing_complete``) hand over to this module
when ``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` is on, and ``apply_kanban_progress_lines.py`` calls
:func:`settle_delegated` after the kanban notifier delivers a terminal event.
With the flag off neither caller reaches anything here, and the adapter keeps
upstream's 👀 then ✅/❌.

Upstream, and why it changes
----------------------------
Upstream adds 👀 when a turn starts, then removes it and adds ✅ or ❌ when the
turn ends. Two things go wrong in a kube-agents install:

* The credential proxy refuses every Slack method ending in ``remove``, so the
  👀 never goes and the ✅ lands beside it anyway.
* The turn that delegates ends in seconds, with an acknowledgement; the work
  runs on the kanban board for minutes after. Upstream's ✅ says "done" at the
  moment the work starts.

With the flag on:

* The arrival reaction says what kind of ask this is, chosen from its words
  before any model call (``slack_presenter.arrival_reaction``): 👀 a question
  or check, 🛠️ a change, 📋 the board, 🚨 an incident.
* Nothing is ever removed.
* A turn that answered directly settles at once: ✅, or ❌ on failure. A
  cancelled turn adds nothing.
* A turn that put new cards on the board, subscribed to this thread, defers
  its settle to those cards, and only those: a card already open when the ask
  arrived is not its to wait on, unless the turn resumed it from ``blocked``
  (answering its question, or retrying it after it gave up). A turn that failed
  after opening them still settles ❌ when they finish, whatever they did. The kanban notifier calls
  :func:`settle_delegated` on each terminal event: ⏸️ as soon as one of the
  ask's cards blocks on the user, and once every one of them has finished, ✅,
  or ❌ if any gave up. A fan-out settles once, when all of it has. Only a
  finish reported while the turn runs, or after it, counts for its ask. Cards
  are read from every live board, as the notifier reads them, and known by
  board and id.

The deferred asks live in this process only (the notifier runs in the gateway
process too). A gateway restart between the turn and the settle loses the
settle, and the ask keeps its arrival reaction alone; nothing is ever put on a
message this process did not see arrive.

Fail-soft throughout: a kanban read that fails, on any board, settles the ask
at once as a direct answer, and a reaction that fails is logged at debug and
the turn carries on, as upstream's ``_react`` already does.
