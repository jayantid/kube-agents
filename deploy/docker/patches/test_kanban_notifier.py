"""Unit tests for the kanban notifier patch installed by deploy/docker/Dockerfile.

Merges what were ``test_kanban_wake_kinds.py`` and ``test_kanban_result_delivery.py``,
and adds :class:`MinimalDiffTest`, which pins what the applier does to upstream's
``gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py``: exactly the lines named in the applier are
removed and added, so each behaviour stays visible as one block.
``test_kanban_handoff_clip.py`` stays separate — it tests the shared text
utility, which has no anchor into upstream source.

Run: python3 -m unittest discover -s deploy/docker/patches -p 'test_*.py' -t deploy/docker/patches

## What's wrong

The `checkout` deployment cannot schedule: every replica is Pending.

## Why

- The pod requests 8Gi and every node in `default-pool` has 4Gi allocatable
  (`kubectl describe node` → `Allocatable: memory: 3910Mi`).

## What to do

- **Option A (Right-size the request):** drop `resources.requests.memory` to 2Gi.
- **Option B (Add a larger node pool):** create an `e2-standard-8` pool.
- ✅ **Recommended: Option A** — no new capacity to pay for or drain later.

# gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py reduced to the lines the patch rewrites,
# kept at their real nesting because all five anchors are indentation-
# sensitive: ``_fmt_completed`` is module-level, ``build_wake_text``,
# ``_send_pings`` and ``deliver`` are methods of ``_KanbanNotification``.
# ``deliver``'s wake step is upstream's verbatim, and ``_send_pings`` keeps the
# ping checkpoint that makes a wake retry skip the ping, because
# DeliverEndToEndTest runs this class. The ``return f"✔`` line
# is anchor 4, and the handoff hook has to land between the clip and it, which
# is the whole contract of anchor 1. ``_WAKE_KINDS`` stays at
# module level in the patched file too: ``build_wake_text`` still orders the
# wake text's parts by it.
