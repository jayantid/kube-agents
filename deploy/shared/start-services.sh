# Entrypoint for the credential-proxy container.
#
# Four peer services live here, not one service with helpers. They share a
# container because they all need credentials, and credentials are deliberately
# kept out of the agent sandbox — not because any of them belongs to another:
#
#   credential_proxy.py   executes credentialed CLIs on behalf of the sandbox
#   envoy                 fronts the credential proxy on loopback
#   k8s-event-watcher     watches cluster API servers and reports events
#   drift-detector        reads GKE admin-activity audit records from Pub/Sub
#                         and reports the ones a person made outside git
#
# CREDENTIAL_PROXY_ROLE selects which of them start, because they no longer all
# run in the same pod. It is the same variable and the same three values
# credential_proxy.py's resolve_role() reads; this script decides which
# processes to launch and that function decides which halves of the runtime to
# serve. `broker` is the credential pod: Envoy and the credential runtime, which
# the sandbox reaches over a Service. `api-proxy` is what is left in the gateway
# pod — the watcher and the drift detector, which both post to the Session KV
# server on that pod's loopback, and the API authenticator, which forwards to
# the Hermes gateway on the same loopback. None of those is a credential path
# the agent container can drive, which is the point of the split. `combined` is
# the sidecar arrangement and stays the default so an image paired with an older
# operator behaves as it did.
#
# They differ in how their failure is treated. Envoy and the credential runtime
# are the container's reason to exist: if either dies the agent loses every
# credentialed command, so their exit ends the container and Kubernetes
# restarts it. The watcher and the drift detector are best-effort observability
# — losing either must not take the credential path down with it, so each is
# supervised and restarted in place instead. They are also the two that can be
# switched off deliberately, in opposite directions: EVENT_WATCHER_ENABLED=false
# skips the watcher, which is the emergency stop for an event storm, while the
# detector starts only when DRIFT_DETECTOR_ENABLED says so, because the Pub/Sub
# subscription it reads exists only where an install asked for it. See
# event_watcher_disabled and drift_detector_enabled below.
set -euo pipefail

# The sandbox runs as a different user (see the UID constants in the operator's
# platformagent_manifests.go) and shares only the agent PVC with this container.
# Proxied commands run here but write there — a clone, a commit, a kubeconfig pin
# in a profile home — and the sandbox has to be able to change what they leave
# behind. The shared fsGroup gives it the group; this gives the group write.
# Credential state lives on this container's own emptyDir volumes, which nothing
# else mounts, so the wider mode does not widen who can read a credential.

# Exported, not just assigned: the runtime reads the same variable, and an

# defaulted here. Two defaults that have to agree is a way for them not to.

#
# Zero is the dangerous value in a backoff, because it survives every check the

# re-exec'd as fast as the kernel allows, for the life of the pod, in the same
# container as the API authenticator. A zero daemon poll never advances the wait
# loop's counter, so the detector is never launched at all — silent in the worst
# way, because a process that never started has no short exits and the
# supervisor's ALERT below cannot fire either.

# A non-numeric value fails harder and just as quietly. `sleep abc` returns
# non-zero and errexit ends the supervisor subshell; worse, the bare-word

# already triaged. The supervisor below restarts the watcher in place, which
# makes that a routine occurrence rather than a rare one.
#
# The data volume, not the container's own state directory: that one is a 16Mi

# scratch — new session, new chat thread, count back to 1.
#
# That is why the binary's own 5m default is the wrong value here rather than

# visible result is the same broken image arriving as an unrelated-looking new

# alert cadence for "still broken, nobody has fixed it" is daily, not hourly.
# The cost is the other side of the same coin, and it is real: a failure that
# genuinely clears and returns later the same day is folded into the original
# incident instead of opening a new one, and the agent is not woken for it.
# A fleet whose failures resolve and recur within a shift wants a smaller value.

# Shut down every supervised process and the subshell supervising it, given the
# supervisors' pids. Three things here are load-bearing and none is obvious: what
# gets signalled, that the wait exists at all, and what the wait watches.
#
# **Signal both, per supervisor.** The supervised process needs SIGTERM because it
# is the one with shutdown work to do. The supervisor needs it because otherwise
# its `while true` loop simply goes round again: the process exits, the loop
# computes `ran`, logs, and reaches its backoff `sleep`, and once that sleep
# elapses it launches a *replacement* underneath this very function. Its
# `trap 'exit 0' TERM` is deferred by bash until the foreground process returns,
# so signalling the two together costs the supervised process nothing -- it still
# gets its full shutdown, and the supervisor then leaves the loop instead of
# restarting it.
#
# Signalling the supervisor is not the same as ending it, which is why the kill
# is at the bottom rather than here. Ending the subshell reparents the process it
# launched to PID 1, after which `pkill -P` on the dead subshell's pid matches
# nothing; the process never sees SIGTERM and is SIGKILLed when this script exits.
#
# **The wait**, because a SIGTERM this script does not outlive is not a shutdown.
# The drift-detector's handler NACKs the records it has not finished with so that
# they redeliver rather than each costing a duplicate inject, and the watcher's
# writes its dedup snapshot so that a restart does not replay every event still
# inside the API server's TTL. Both take seconds; this script exits milliseconds
# after terminate() returns, and takes the PID namespace with it.
#
# **The wait watches the supervisors, not their children.** With the trap above, a
# supervisor exits only once its foreground process has returned, so its own exit
# is the completion signal and it arrives no earlier -- whereas its child set goes
# empty in the instant between the process returning and the trap running, which
# is a break before the loop has actually been left. Bash reaps its own background
# jobs, so `kill -0` on an exited supervisor fails rather than finding a zombie.
#
# **The bottom kill is SIGKILL**, and only reached when the budget ran out. A
# second SIGTERM would be deferred by the trap exactly as the first one was, so it
# could not end a supervisor whose process is ignoring the signal -- which is the
# only state a supervisor can still be in by the time the loop above gives up.

# install that says nothing has no subscription to read: starting it there
# gives a process that stays up and retries a failing pull for the life of the
# pod, filling the pod log without ever being able to work. It does not exit, so
# the supervisor below never sees it fail and the pod stays Ready throughout.
#
# It therefore fails towards not starting, including on a value it does not
# recognise, where the watcher's equivalent fails towards running. The two

# install what it had before this feature existed, and one that starts without
