"""Verify that relative links in Markdown resolve, and that every document is linked.

This catches the failure mode that actually occurs in this repository: a
relative path that was correct when written and silently broke when a file
moved or a directory was renamed. It also catches the opposite: a document
that nothing points at, which no reader will find and no review will re-read.

Scope is deliberately narrow and offline:

* relative links and image paths are resolved against the linking file and
  must point at a git-tracked file (or a directory) -- existence on disk is
  not enough, because generated or ignored files exist in a local clone but
  not in a fresh checkout or on GitHub;
* ``http(s)``, ``mailto:`` and protocol-relative links are not fetched;
* site-absolute routes (``/kube-agents/...``) are Starlight routes rather than
  paths on disk, so they are skipped -- broken ones surface as a failed site
  build in ``docs-build.yml``;
* anchors are stripped before resolution, and a bare ``#anchor`` is skipped;
* a ``docs/designs/...`` or ``docs/architecture/...`` path written inside a
  code or configuration file (the ``CODE_GLOBS`` below: Python, Go, shell,
  Dockerfiles, YAML, Terraform, TypeScript) is resolved from the repository
  root and must be git-tracked too. Comments cite design documents as the
  reasoning behind what they sit above, and a citation of a document that
  was never merged reads the same as a real one (#992). No other path in
  those files is inspected. A test fixture that needs a fake document path
  cites something like ``docs/x.md``, outside the two directories, as the
  existing ones do, or assembles the path from parts at runtime the way
  this script's own tests do; a literal in a tracked file is a citation
  like any other;
* every tracked ``.md``/``.mdx`` outside a root-level dot-directory must be
  reachable from where a reader starts. The starting points are the documents
  a reader reaches without a link: files at the repository root (the front
  door), any ``README.md`` (its directory reaches it), the tooling under the
  root dot-directories, the site pages Starlight's sidebar lists (read from
  ``SITE_CONFIG``: every page under an ``autogenerate`` directory, every
  page an entry names by ``link:``, ``slug:`` or the bare-string shorthand,
  and the ``404`` page it serves by convention), the uniform
  families in ``LINK_EXEMPT_FAMILY_GLOBS``, which a reader reaches by
  browsing the directory and which no page links one by one, and every
  design document a code file cites. From there, reach follows links: a
  relative link, a site route (``/kube-agents/...``), or a repository blob
  URL (the form the generated skill catalogue uses; the URL itself is not
  fetched or validated), however the link is written -- a Markdown link, a
  reference-style definition, an autolink, or an HTML or JSX ``href``
  attribute, which is how the site's hub pages link their sections
  (``<LinkCard href=...>``). A link inside a fenced block, an inline code
  span, an HTML comment or an MDX comment is a specimen or a leftover, not
  a link: it reaches nothing and is not reported as broken either. A
  document linked only from documents no reader
  reaches is as unreachable as one linked from nowhere, and is reported the
  same way. The documents that were unreachable when the rule arrived are
  named in ``UNLINKED_ALLOWLIST``; the list only shrinks -- an entry that
  becomes reachable, becomes exempt by shape, or is deleted fails the check
  until it is dropped.

Standard library only, so it runs in CI and in a bare clone.

# whose closer never comes is text.
#
# This is not hypothetical tidiness. Seven documents quote the fleet-audit
# finding-id pattern `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9._-]{0,98}[a-z0-9])?$`, and the `](`
# inside it reads to LINK_RE as a markdown link to `[a-z0-9._-]{0,98}[a-z0-9]`,
# which is not a file. The checker reported seven broken links in seven
# correct documents.
#
# A span may wrap onto the next line but not across a blank line or into a
# new block, as a Markdown renderer reads one, so the lines outside fences are
# read a paragraph at a time, and a paragraph ends where a heading, a list
# item, a table row, a blockquote or a thematic break begins, and again after
# a heading, a table row or a thematic break, which are one line long: a
# renderer parses each of those inline on its own, so a lone backtick in one
# list item never pairs with one in the next and hides the link between
# them, while a span that wraps onto a plain continuation line is still one
# span. A blockquote's lines are read with their markers removed, as a
# renderer reads them, so a span or a comment may wrap from one `>` line to
# the next, and a quoted heading, list item or marker-only line still ends the
# paragraph inside the quote. Reading a span one line at a time was wrong in
# the unsafe direction once comments were stripped too: a `<!--` quoted in a span that wraps
# stayed visible and opened a comment that swallowed the rest of the
# document, links included. A block boundary is believed at any indent, in
# spaces or tabs, for the reason a comment opener is (below): CommonMark
# measures an item's indent from the enclosing item, the checker tracks no

# HTML and MDX comments, for the same reason again: a link an author commented
# out instead of deleting renders nowhere, so it reaches no document -- the
# rule the sidebar read applies to a JavaScript comment, one file over -- and
# it is not a broken link either. A comment may span lines and paragraphs; the
# lines inside one are dropped and the report's line numbers keep meaning what
# they say. An MDX comment is one only in an `.mdx` file; in a `.md` file the
# same characters render as text. Spans and comments are read in one pass,
# left to right, and whichever opens first wins, as a renderer decides it: a
# `<!--` quoted inside a span is a specimen, and a backtick inside a comment
# is part of the comment. An opener with no closer is text, as an unclosed
# backtick run is, and where the closer may be depends on where the opener
# stands, as a renderer decides it: an opener that is the first content of its
# line (CommonMark's HTML block) may close in any later paragraph; one in the
# middle of a prose line is inline HTML, which cannot cross a blank line, so
# it is a comment only when its closer is in the same paragraph. The block
# form is believed at any indent, in spaces or tabs, and behind the markers
# that open a container block, a blockquote's `>` and a list item's bullet or
# number: CommonMark allows three spaces measured from the enclosing item, the
# item's or quote's content is a block sequence of its own, and the checker
# tracks neither, so an opener alone on its line four spaces in under a
# numbered item, or opening an item or a quote, is the block it renders as,
# not inline HTML that keeps the links it hides. An HTML block runs to the end
# of the line its closer is on, so what follows the closer there is raw HTML
# and not a link, while inline HTML ends at its closer and the rest of its
# line is prose; an MDX comment is an expression, which ends at its closer
# either way. Otherwise a bare `<!--` in prose, or one whose closer an edit
# lost, blanked the rest of the document up to the next comment, which most
# documents hold (a prettier-ignore, a generated-region marker), and the
# broken-link check went green over links it never read. (CommonMark reads an
