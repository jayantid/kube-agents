# Unified Provisioning Script for CI Pool Projects
# ==============================================================================
# Provisions all GCP, GKE, IAM, Artifact Registry, Seeded Fleet, and Token
# Minter infrastructure required to onboard a GCP project into the Prow Boskos
# evaluation pool (kube-agents-evals-project).
#
# Follows the sequence codified in
# docs/ci-pool-projects.md.
#
# The project itself and its billing link are preconditions: this script
# provisions *into* a project that already exists and already bills.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/provision_ci_pool_project.sh --project-id=kube-agents-evals-4
#   ./scripts/provision_ci_pool_project.sh --project-id=kube-agents-evals-3 --pem-file=/path/to/app.pem

`notification-relay` in `seeded-intent` runs two replicas with no PodDisruptionBudget by design:
it is a stateless relay whose clients retry, and a budget would only slow node drains. The
namespace carries no NetworkPolicy by design either: nothing in it accepts traffic. `token-reader`
in `seeded-token` runs on the default ServiceAccount of its namespace with the token mounted by
design: it reads the API server with that identity. Its neighbour `token-sidecar` is not declared.
`seeded-c` publishes no GKE upgrade notifications by design: this fleet learns about upgrades from
the weekly audit. `burst-ingest` in `seeded-headroom` requests far more memory than it uses by
design: it is sized for an ingest burst the measured week does not show. The obtainability,
compliance, upgrade readiness and waste audits list the five postures under Declared intent rather
than as findings.'

    # not check the ingress yet, and section 8 of docs/ci-pool-projects.md
    # forbids re-running this script on a registered project. So a project
