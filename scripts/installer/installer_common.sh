# Shared definitions for the kube-agents installer front-ends.
# ==============================================================================
# Sourced by install.sh, uninstall.sh, and upgrade.sh — and this is where the
# terraform.tfvars generator lives, so the three front-ends describe the same
# install to the same engine (terraform/examples/full-install).
#
# Contract: the caller defines print_info / print_warning / print_error before
# calling anything here that reports. Functions read the install.env variable

# ─── Shared Installer Defaults ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every default an install gets for saying nothing lives in install.defaults.env
# at the repository root, beside install.env. One file, one job: this one has
# none of them inline, and a point of use reads its DEFAULT_* key rather than
# repeating the value. The exception is a fallback that deliberately differs
# from the fresh-install default because it describes an install that already
# exists -- `${ENABLE_GVISOR:-false}` here and in install.sh's control panel,
# each with the argument beside it. Precedence is
# install.defaults.env → an exported environment variable → install.env → a flag.
# install.env is sourced with `set -a`, which is what puts it above the export.
#
# Sourced WITHOUT `set -a`, unlike install.env. These stay shell variables: they
# are this project's defaults, not the install's configuration, and exporting
# them would put DEFAULT_* into the environment Terraform and the agent see.
#
# Resolved relative to this file rather than the working directory, because
# upgrade.sh and uninstall.sh source these helpers from a fresh clone whose
# path nobody knows in advance.

# ─── Control-plane endpoint selection ─────────────────────────────────────────
# gke_dns_endpoint_flag, the one predicate deciding whether a cluster is reached
# over its IP or its DNS control-plane endpoint. Sourced here rather than left
# to the caller: common.sh and install.sh source the helper themselves, but
# uninstall.sh sources only this file, and calling an undefined function under
# `set -e` would end the run. Sourcing it twice is harmless — it defines a
# function and initialises its memo, both at load time, before anything probes.
#
# Resolved relative to this file, like the defaults above and for the same
# reason. Unlike upgrade.sh, which reads the helper out of a checkout because it
# also runs piped from curl, this file is only ever sourced from one.
#
# A tree without the helper gets a stub rather than a refusal, which is the
# answer the helper itself gives for a cluster it cannot describe: the empty
# flag is the command that ran before the helper existed, and it still reaches
# every cluster with a routable IP endpoint. The defaults above refuse because
# they decide what gets installed; this only picks an endpoint to dial, and an
# uninstall or upgrade is not worth stopping over it.
#
# uninstall.sh and upgrade.sh reach the stub: both source this file before
# anything else loads the helper. install.sh does not — common.sh sources the
# helper unguarded ahead of this file and would already have stopped on the
# same missing file. It says so rather than falling back in silence, because
# the next thing that caller sees is an unrelated-looking missing key.

# Refuses a full apply that would replace a scope the live PlatformAgent
# carries and nothing this install wrote accounts for.
#
# The chart renders spec.scope from the keys on every full apply, and Helm
# patches a custom resource from the difference between its rendered
# manifests, so the first apply that renders the block replaces whatever the
# CR holds -- and the reconcile reads the emptied projects list as the
# declaration that retires those projects' profiles. Three values decide:
#
#   L  the live CR's spec.scope;
#   R  the release record's platformAgent.scope (helm get values): what the
#      installer last rendered, absent before the first apply that carried
#      the value, and never anything else, because the retag modes reuse the
#      record as it is. Read from the latest revision and from the last
#      revision that served (deployed or superseded), because a failed
#      upgrade leaves its values as the latest revision while the CR still
#      holds the served one, and the retry must not read that as a hand edit;
#   K  the scope the SCOPE_* keys declare now.
#
# Refused when L is present and non-empty (a list, an exclusion, or a cap off
# the CRD's default), L != R and L != K: the CR carries a
# declaration the installer did not write and the keys do not reproduce. Every
# other case passes -- nothing live to protect; L == R, the installer wrote it
# and the keys are the new declaration, emptying it included; L == K, the
# operator recorded it. No PlatformAgent type served, no CR, no release: pass.
# L, R and K are the projects, folders, organisations, Shared VPC hosts,
# Metrics Scopes and exclusions, every list the chart renders, since a list it
# renders is one the apply replaces, the cap, which the apply sets the same
# way (a CR at the CRD's default reads as the key unset), and the scoped
# pool's switch, spec.security.scopedServiceAccountPool.enabled, which the
# generator writes from SCOPED_SA_POOL_ENABLED alone (false when the key is
# absent): a live true the key does not record would be disarmed by the apply,
# its members destroyed and the broker put on the ambient credential, so it
# weighs like a cap off the default, an armed pool alone included. The members
# list is derived from the scope and is not compared.
# Anything that stops the read -- no context for this install in the
# kubeconfig, the CR or the record unreadable -- is a refusal, because the
# apply itself needs no kubeconfig (the helm provider authenticates with a
# token against the endpoint) and would go ahead over a scope nobody read.

# Refuse an apply that would stop on a service account this install does not

# re-install after a teardown that never ran uninstall.sh -- reaches the apply
# with an account that exists in GCP and not in its state, and Terraform 409s
# on it halfway through (#1294). Caught here, before anything is applied, the
# failure names the key that un-collides it.
#
# Refused rather than adopted, deliberately. An import cannot tell a leftover
# from another live install's identity, and adopting the second puts that

# deletes it out from under the other one, with no message on that side. A

# upgrade.sh, since a minter or Vertex GSA is first planned on whichever of
# them enables the feature. A describe that fails for any reason other than
# absence -- no permission to read IAM, say -- counts as absent here and lets
# the apply report it, which is no worse than today. State that cannot be READ
# is different: "not in state" then means nothing, and the remedy below would
# tell a healthy install to delete its own account, so the check stands down
# and says so. Caller defines print_error / print_info / print_warning.
