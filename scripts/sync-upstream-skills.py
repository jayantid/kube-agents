## Required final step: provision the Cluster Agent profile

Creating a cluster is **not complete** until it has a Cluster Agent. A managed cluster and its
Cluster Agent profile are **created together** — never leave a newly created cluster without a
profile. Immediately after `create_cluster` succeeds and the cluster is reachable, create its
dedicated **Cluster Agent** profile (this is what makes the cluster delegable for runtime
debugging). Use the [cluster-agent-lifecycle](../cluster-agent-lifecycle/SKILL.md) skill:

```bash
python3 /opt/data/scripts/cluster_agent_profile.py create \\
  --project "<project>" --cluster "<cluster>" --location "<location>"
```

The command is idempotent, so it is safe to re-run. This gives the new cluster an agent
immediately. (The `cluster-agent-reconcile` cron would also pick it up on its next run — it
manages every cluster in every project in scope, so no labeling is required.)

## Cluster Agent Profile Teardown

A managed cluster and its Cluster Agent profile are **deleted together**. When a cluster is
decommissioned/deleted, also remove its dedicated **Cluster Agent** profile (created at onboarding).
Use the [cluster-agent-lifecycle](../cluster-agent-lifecycle/SKILL.md) skill:

```bash
python3 /opt/data/scripts/cluster_agent_profile.py delete \\
  --project "<project>" --cluster "<cluster>" --location "<location>"
```

Do not delete a Cluster Agent profile while its cluster still exists.

Deleting the profile here is the immediate, preferred path. As a backstop, the hourly
`cluster-agent-reconcile` job auto-prunes any profile whose cluster is definitively gone, so a
profile missed during teardown is cleaned up on the next reconcile cycle.

## Before recommending GPU/TPU or large-shape capacity

Before recommending capacity for a GPU/TPU or large-shape design, load the
[capacity-obtainability](../capacity-obtainability/SKILL.md) skill and run its diagnostics:
verify the regional quota for the exact accelerator metric (e.g. `NVIDIA_A100_GPUS`), then gather
capacity obtainability advice (`gcloud beta compute advice capacity`) for the requested machine
shape and count across the region's zones, for the Spot and Flex-Start provisioning models the
advice API accepts. That skill owns the rules for what to probe and how to report it; follow it
rather than restating them here.
""",
    "gke-networking": f"""{FOOTER_MARKER}

## Before you pass `--dns-endpoint`

The `get-credentials --dns-endpoint` example above works only on a cluster that publishes a DNS
endpoint **and** has `controlPlaneEndpointsConfig.dnsEndpointConfig.allowExternalTraffic` set to
true. Check first:

```bash
gcloud container clusters describe {{cluster_name}} --region {{region}} \\
  --format='value(controlPlaneEndpointsConfig.dnsEndpointConfig.endpoint,controlPlaneEndpointsConfig.dnsEndpointConfig.allowExternalTraffic)'
```

Do not infer support from the command succeeding. When external traffic is disabled, a caller that
Google treats as internal gets a warning rather than an error, plus a kubeconfig pointing at the
DNS endpoint that then returns HTTP 403 on first use — a failure that surfaces one step later than
its cause. `gcloud container clusters update {{cluster_name}} --enable-dns-access` turns the
setting on.

The Platform Agent's own tooling makes this decision per cluster in
`/opt/data/scripts/gke_endpoint.py`, so `switch_kube_context` and the Cluster Agent profile
scaffolding already pass the flag exactly when it applies; the check above is for the times you
run `get-credentials` by hand. That decision is re-read about once a minute per cluster, so after
enabling the setting, wait a moment before retrying rather than concluding it did not work.

    "gke-upgrades": f"""{FOOTER_MARKER}

## Executed version checks: the fleet-upgrade-verification skill

This skill plans one upgrade at a time; its references read one cluster at a time. When the
question is which clusters in a fleet lag a target version, by how many minors, and whether the
control plane or a node pool is the laggard, run the
[fleet-upgrade-verification](../fleet-upgrade-verification/SKILL.md) skill's script and paste its
table rather than reasoning from memory:

```bash
./skills/fleet-upgrade-verification/scripts/fleet_upgrade_report.py --target-version <version> \\
  --output /opt/data/scratch/fleet_versions.json
```

Without `--target-version` it measures each cluster against its own release channel's default and
prints that baseline per member. Run again during a rollout, it says which members started,
completed or stalled since the previous run. Without `--readiness` (below) it reads with
`gcloud container` only and changes nothing in GCP; the only thing it then writes is its own
record of each run under `/opt/data/state/fleet-upgrade-verification/`. The plan, runbook and
checklist for the members it flags are this skill's job.

The same script's `--readiness` flag executes three items of this skill's pre-upgrade checklist
per member, against the same target: PodDisruptionBudgets that would block a node drain
(`maxUnavailable: 0`, or `minAvailable` demanding every expected pod), maintenance exclusions and
the maintenance window at a given instant (`--at`, default now), and node-pool version skew
against the target control plane. Run it before writing the plan and carry its `blocked` rows into
the checklist rather than asking the operator to check those three by hand. The PDB read costs one
`get-credentials` and one `kubectl get` per member and leaves a per-member kubeconfig under
`${{HERMES_HOME:-/opt/data}}/.kubeconfigs/`; an exclusion is reported as holding back automatic
upgrades only.

When the checklist's deprecated-API item comes up, the same skill's `api_deprecation_scan.py` scans
the linked GitOps repositories' manifests for apiVersions the target removes and reports each with
its replacement and the commit it read; run it with `--target-version` and the version report's
`--output`. It reads Git only: point at GKE Deprecation Insights for live client usage.

## Before scheduling a GPU/TPU batch job with a deadline

Before recommending a start time, zone, or capacity path for a GPU/TPU or large-shape batch job —
especially one that must finish inside a horizon — load the
[capacity-obtainability](../capacity-obtainability/SKILL.md) skill and run its **Future windows**
section: verify the regional quota for the exact accelerator metric, probe
`gcloud beta compute advice calendar-mode` once per candidate region for the job's shape, count,
duration, and horizon, and rank the returned windows. That skill owns the probe's flags, the
chips-per-node arithmetic, the ranking rule, and the paired ProvisioningRequest + LocalQueue
