# Confirm the tag a deploy just set actually reached the gateway's pod template.
#
# The agent redeploy's only change is `helm upgrade --set
# platformAgent.deployment.image.tag=<sha>` on the PlatformAgent CR, and the
# operator is free to ignore it. resolveAgentImage
# (k8s-operator/internal/controller/manifest_helpers.go) consults
# spec.deployment.tag only when spec.deployment.image is set *and* carries no
# tag or digest of its own, so there are two ways for the deploy's tag to stop
# meaning anything: a `kubectl patch` pinning a full reference, which then
# decides the image outright; or an unset spec.deployment.image, which sends
# the operator to its own default image and past the tag entirely.
#
# The check is tag-only. It does not compare the repository, because a mirrored
# install legitimately serves the release images from its own registry -- so a
# CR pointed at a foreign repository on this deploy's tag passes here. That is
# a cluster-write-access problem rather than one a CI read-back can police.
#
# Such a pin survives, which is the part worth spelling out because the chart
# does render spec.deployment.image on every upgrade
# (charts/kube-agents/templates/platform-agent-cr.yaml). It renders the bare
# repository, byte-identical release to release, and Helm computes a plain JSON
# merge patch between the previous and new rendered manifests for a custom
# resource rather than the three-way merge it does for built-in types -- a
# field the same in both is simply absent from the patch, so the live value is
# never touched. `kubectl get platformagent -o yaml --show-managed-fields` is
# how to confirm that on a live CR: had Helm's patch carried the field, Helm
# would own it, and a pin shows `kubectl-patch` owning it instead.
#
# Nothing downstream catches that. With the resolved image unchanged the
# operator writes no new pod template, so `kubectl rollout status` returns
# success against a ReplicaSet that was already complete, and the deploy is
# green while the cluster is untouched. Hence a read-back, and hence its
# position before the rollout gate.
#
# Every release image in the template is checked, not just the agent
# container's. The operator renders the agent container, the
# sandbox-credential-cleanup init container, the platform-agent-dashboard
# container (on by default), the agent-api-auth sidecar and, for each enabled
# AgentPlugin, either a stage-<plugin> init container or a plugin-<name> image
# volume, depending on whether the cluster supports ImageVolumeSource. The credential
# proxy is a Deployment of its own, which this script is not pointed at and so
# does not cover, and neither is the shell sandbox StatefulSet. The proxy's
# image reference is derived from resolveAgentImage's output, so it normally
# moves with the agent's. It does not when the agent image is digest-pinned:
# that path falls back to spec.deployment.tag, so the agent freezes at its
# digest while the proxy rolls forward on every deploy. The operator logs that
# and carries on.
#
# The check is that no release image found is off the tag, not that a
# particular set of them is present. Which containers the operator renders
# depends on the CR -- the dashboard is switchable -- so an expected count
# would be wrong for some valid installs. A
# template that lost a container entirely therefore passes here; the rollout
# gate and the agent's own probes are what cover that.
#
# Which images count comes from images.json -- the first-party entries on the
# release tag policy -- matched on the trailing path segment of the
# repository. Matching on a registry prefix instead would be wrong for a
# mirrored install: `mirror_images.sh` writes <prefix>/<name> and
# thirdPartyImageRegistry falls back to imageRegistry, so a single-prefix
# mirror puts fluent-bit under the same prefix as the release images and a
# prefix rule would demand the deploy's tag of a third-party pin.
#
# Usage: confirm_agent_image.sh <namespace> <deployment> <tag>
#
# The budget is the operator's reconcile latency, not a rollout: it is
# event-driven off the CR write and normally lands in seconds. It deliberately
# sits outside the startupProbe < rollout gate < progressDeadlineSeconds
# ordering that tests/test_gateway_rollout_budgets.py pins, because it waits
# for the Deployment to be written at all -- before the clock those three share
# starts. 300s is the figure scripts/release/wait_for_gke_readiness.sh has used
# for this same read-back; one number for one wait, rather than a second one
# derived nowhere. It has to absorb an operator that is itself mid-rollout: the
# agent and controller redeploys sit in separate concurrency groups and can
# overlap.
