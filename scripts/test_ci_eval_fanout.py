"""The eval fan-out's scheduler is model-free shell, so it is testable here.

`hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` launches one background unit per (task, repetition) and
serializes the collisions with three mkdir mutexes (task, stream, infra). Three properties carry the
correctness of that scheme and each is exercised against the REAL text lifted
out of the script, in the same style as test_ci_eval_trap.py:

  - the lock deadline: a holder that died without releasing must convert into
    a loud per-unit failure, never a silent spin `wait` can outlast;
  - lock mutual exclusion: two contenders never hold one lock at once;
  - queue order: repetition-major, cost-descending within a repetition, so a
    lane is never parked on the task lock of a unit launched seconds earlier
    (the 2026-08-31 pool run paid two of four lanes for twelve minutes that
    way).

The run-directory recovery regex is pinned too: it is what replaced the
directory-set diff that could not tell concurrent siblings apart.

Since the per-case grading moved into the fan-out (#1491: a deadline-cut
night must still record every case that finished), a fourth property joins
them: the unit that brings a case's repetition count to EVAL_REPETITIONS --
and only that unit -- grades and records the case, and a repetition that gave
up on its lock leaves the case for the loop after the fan-out.
