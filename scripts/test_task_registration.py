"""Every bench case is valid, and in a roster file under hack/eval/ or excluded.

`hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` runs the cases named in hack/eval/presubmit-cases.txt
and, under EVAL_TIER=nightly, hack/eval/nightly-cases.txt -- and only those:
tasks under bench/tasks/ are not picked up automatically, the files' headers
say so, and nothing owned the difference between "left out on purpose" and
"nobody remembered". That is how agent-kanban-smoke -- a task whose whole
point is to smoke the deployed pipeline -- sat registered nowhere while the
presubmit ran one task for months. A task nobody registered is the same
failure as a domain nobody covered.

This test owns that difference, and four more like it. The rules and the
allowlists live in scripts/validate_bench_cases.py, which `make
bench-case-check` also runs. Sharing the implementation is only half of what
it takes for the two to agree: this lint also has to assert on everything that
module returns rather than on a hand-listed set of substrings, which is what
TestEveryTaskIsValid's whole-set assertion is for -- see its docstring for the
rules that leaked through before it existed. `make bench-case-check` is
invoked by no workflow; this lint, reached through PYTHON_TEST_DIRS in the
Makefile and run by .github/workflows/python-tests.yml, is the whole of the
enforcement on a pull request. A case passes by an entry in the presubmit
file, by an entry in the nightly file (where a new case lands by default and
earns a presubmit seat on its record -- decided 2026-09-15 on #1546/#1564),
by a FIXTURE_NOT_READY entry in the validator naming the issue that plants
its fixture, or by a reviewed KNOWN_UNREGISTERED entry with the reason. The
commented-out registration the script's TASKS array used to accept is
retired: a case path inside a roster-file comment is a finding.

This lint and scripts/test_domain_coverage.py ratchet together. That one
counts a domain covered only when a task carrying its slug and a non-empty
verification_spec is on the BLOCKING ROSTER, so neither a nightly-only task
nor a held-out presubmit seat counts as coverage; this one guarantees every
task is at least registered
and internally valid.

The files are read with the parse in scripts/eval_rosters.py, the Python copy
of the sed the script applies; scripts/test_eval_rosters.py holds the two to
the same answer. A parse that finds nothing fails loudly rather than passing
vacuously.

    The per-rule layer was the whole gate for one commit, and it leaked. Every
