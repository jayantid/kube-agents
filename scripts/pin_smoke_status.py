"""Keep a green `pull-kube-agents-smoke-test` status valid when `main` moves.

Tide credits a presubmit only against the base SHA it ran on. Crier writes that
SHA into the commit status as a `BaseSHA:<sha>` suffix, and Tide reads it back
(`prowJobsFromContexts`) so a result outlives the ProwJob object -- as long as
the SHA still names the head of `main`. Every merge to `main` therefore turns
every other pull request's green smoke run stale, and Tide re-runs the job for a
pull request whose head has not changed (#1179, #1202). Step 0 of that job,
hack/ci-revalidate.sh, answers such a retest in minutes from the head's own green
where it once cost the 1.5-3.5h matrix; the re-pin spares even that.

This re-pins the suffix. On every push to `main` it sweeps the open pull
requests and re-posts each green smoke status with `BaseSHA:` set to the new
head; when a green arrives after `main` has already moved past the base it
ran on, the `status` event does the same for that one commit. The description
says what happened, so a reader is not told the run was against a base it was
not. Tide's newer form of this -- a `[prow:skip-retest]` sentinel that
`/override-sticky` writes -- is upstream since July 2026 but not in the Prow
build this repository merges through (its plugin help does not list
`/override-sticky`); when it is, append the sentinel here and stop pinning.

It is best-effort against Tide's own clock. Tide syncs about once a minute,
and a sync that sees the stale statuses before the sweep has re-pinned them
starts the retest -- as a batch, when two or more pull requests qualify --
and crier's `pending` is then the newer word, which this leaves alone. So the
sweep is kept short (no dependencies, one read per open pull request, and two
more -- `main` again, the status again -- only for the ones it writes), takes
the pull requests Tide is actually waiting on first, and is still a race that
is sometimes lost. Two merges seconds apart start two sweeps with no ordering
between them, so a pin is always made to the head of `main` as read just
before the write, never to the head the run started with.

An admin `/override` is pinned the same way as a green. The plugin on this
Prow build posts a bare `Overridden by <user>`, and crier posts a second
status with the same `BaseSHA:` suffix a green carries when it reports the
success ProwJob the plugin creates; whichever is the latest, Tide reads it the
way it reads a green, and so does this (a bare one has no base, which is a
stale one). So a plain `/override` holds for the head it was given until a
push whenever the sweep wins the race above, instead of having to be repeated
after every merge to `main` (#1202). A lost race no longer costs the override:
the retest's step 0 (hack/ci-revalidate.sh) reads the status the Prow bot
posts for the admin's `/override`, the one pointing at that comment, and
reuses it as it does a green, so the retest exits green in
seconds instead of running the job that was overridden because it cannot
pass; the override then holds until a push (step 0 would honour an
`/override-cancel`, which this Prow build lacks). Upstream's
`/override-sticky` sentinel has no race at all, which is one more reason to
switch.

What it will not do: touch a status that is not `success`, pin a pull request
that does not target `main` (Tide keys the base SHA on the pull request's own
base branch), or overwrite a newer status on the same context. Deciding and
writing are separate calls, and a throttled call retries with a delay of
seconds to a minute, so the status is read a second time immediately before
the write and the write is dropped if a newer one has landed. What stays open
is the POST itself. One pull request failing
-- a head force-pushed away mid-sweep, a call out of retries -- is logged and
the sweep goes on, because every pull request after it would otherwise wait
for the next merge; the failure still sets the exit status.
