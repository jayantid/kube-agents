"""Measure how long CI runs wait before they get a pod, and say why when it is long.

The evaluation pool has a fixed number of projects. When demand outgrows it, the
symptom is not a failure -- every run still passes -- it is that runs sit in the
queue longer and longer, and nobody notices until someone happens to look at a
pull request that took three hours to start. GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra#2666
was found that way, by hand, after the fact; the runs that queued for an hour on
the other days of that fortnight were never looked at.

This measures the wait directly, from data Prow already writes, and prints:

  * a per-day table of p50/p95/max over the window, so a bad Tuesday does not
    disappear into a quiet week;
  * a roll-call of individual runs that waited too long, because a single
    75-minute wait among five runs moves no percentile and is exactly the case
    that goes unseen;
  * whether a breach is the pool being full (onboard another project) or the
    Prow control plane not dispatching (oss-test-infra#2666, where onboarding
    would spend money and fix nothing).

That last distinction is the one worth being careful about. A long wait with an
*idle* pool is not a capacity problem, and the only way to tell from outside is
to ask Boskos how many projects are actually leased at the time.

Three sources, three questions, and each degrades on its own rather than taking
the run down with it:

  GCS     pr-logs/, the trend over the window.        The onboarding gauge.
  Deck    prowjobs.js, what is queued right now.      The incident alarm.
  Boskos  /metric, how much of the pool is leased.    The capacity verdict.

Only GCS is required. Deck and Boskos each add a question this cannot answer
without them, and their absence is reported rather than assumed away.
