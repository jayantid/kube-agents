"""Scan every CI pool project's seeded fleet for fixture drift, on the health bot's clock.

Presence probes passed on 2026-09-07 while `payments-api` sat Pending on all
30 pool projects (#1278). hack/fleet-fixture-state.py (#1544) is the check
that would have failed, and this is where it runs on a schedule rather than
per lease: once an hour the CI health workflow (.github/workflows/ci-health.yml,
job `fixture-state-scan`) runs it against every pool project and publishes
`fixture-state.json` beside health.json. health.py reads that file for its
`fixture_drift` condition and post_health.py puts one line of it in the 9 AM
digest (docs/ci-health.md, "The seeded-fleet scan").

Per project, in a temporary directory of its own:

    hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh       discover the fleet, publish one kubeconfig per role
    hack/fleet-fixture-state.py     assert each published role's designed state,
                                    --wait 0, --report so the verdicts arrive as JSON

Every read runs as that project's seeded-fleet reader
(`seeded-fleet-reader@<project>`, bench/tf/fleet). CLOUDSDK_AUTH_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
makes gcloud impersonate it for the cluster listing, the credentials and the
control-plane describes; FLEET_READONLY_SA makes the runner rewrite each
kubeconfig so kubectl's token is minted as it too. For this scan the bot
therefore needs one grant per pool project -- roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
on that account, the grant #1238 gave the presubmit's identity; the read roles
it holds on the project itself serve the pool-state scan (pool_state.py), not
this one. The impersonation is pre-flighted with one token mint, so
a project missing the grant is "not checked" with gcloud's own words rather
than a runner that could not list clusters.

The project list is `gitops_repo_for_project()` in hack/ci-deploy.sh, the one
list of pool projects this repository holds. The leasable roster is Boskos's
(gke-internal/test-infra), and every leasable project is mapped here first:
scripts/verify_ci_pool_project.py refuses to pass one that is not. A mapped
project that is not provisioned, not visible to the bot, or missing the grant
scans as "not checked", which is the point -- the scan says what it could not
see instead of guessing.

Nothing here fails the bot's run. A missing kubectl or gcloud, an unreachable
project, a runner that timed out, a project without the grant: each is
"not checked" with its reason, per role, and the exit is 0. Only a repository
bug (no mapping in ci-deploy.sh, no catalog) exits 1.

Run:  python3 scripts/eval_dashboard/fixture_state.py --out fixture-state.json [--prior fixture-state.json]
Test: cd scripts && python3 -m unittest test_eval_dashboard_fixture_state
