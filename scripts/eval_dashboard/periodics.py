"""The Prow periodics that keep the pool in shape, read for the CI health bot.

The pull sweep and the two seeded-fleet reconciles run on the build cluster and
report nowhere but TestGrid. This module reads each one's latest finished build
from the bucket they log to, gs://kube-agents-periodic-logs (`latest-build.txt`,
then `finished.json`, then, for a failed build, the artifact the job wrote) and turns a failed or overdue run into
a note health.py carries and post_health.py posts once, with the job's history
link and, for the reconcile, the projects it refused or could not finish.

    fetch --out-dir DIR      one <job>.json per watched periodic that has a
                             finished build; a job that has never run writes
                             nothing, and nothing here fails the tick.

Which jobs are watched is WATCHED below; adding a periodic is one entry.
