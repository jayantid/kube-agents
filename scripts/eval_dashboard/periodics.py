"""The Prow periodics that keep the pool in shape, read for the CI health bot.

The pull sweep and the seeded-fleet reconciles run on the build cluster and
report nowhere but TestGrid. This module reads each one's latest finished build
from the bucket they log to, gs://kube-agents-periodic-logs (`latest-build.txt`,
then `finished.json`, then the report the job wrote and any extra report the
entry names, on every finished build) and turns a failed or overdue run into
a note health.py carries and post_health.py posts once, with the job's history
link and the report's detail: for the reconcile the projects it refused or
could not finish, for the sweep the projects whose sweep failed and what the run
left for the next one. A passed build's report becomes the one-line summary the
recovery message carries (`periodics_runs`).

    fetch --out-dir DIR      one <job>.json per watched periodic that has a
                             finished build; a job that has never run writes
                             nothing, and nothing here fails the tick.

Which jobs are watched is WATCHED below; adding a periodic is one entry.
