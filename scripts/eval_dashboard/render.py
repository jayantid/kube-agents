"""Render the eval dashboard from the collector's data.json.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/eval_dashboard/render.py --data data.json --out-dir out/ \\
        [--health health.json] [--health-history health-history.jsonl] \\
        [--store store.json] [--public-url [BASE]]

writes six pages and two data files into ``out/``:

* ``index.html`` -- **the Brief**: what state the smoke gate is in, why the
  bot thinks so, what the agent saw, what changed right before, what is
  being done, the runs in the window and the last release-candidate eval
  runs. Scoped by ``#since=<ISO>&until=<ISO>&cases=a,b&view=gate`` to a
  past incident; ``#view=agent`` shows the last 24 hours in numbers
  (SCHEMA.md, "URL contract"; the older ``?cases=…#gate`` form is still
  read).
* ``run.html#build=<prow build id>`` -- **the PR view**: one run, its
  failed cases each tagged as the gate's or the pull request's
  (``classify.py``), and what to do.
* ``grid.html`` -- **the Grid**: every case by every presubmit run in a
  window, with the merges to main and the incidents marked between the
  columns; a cell opens the run's detail for that case. Scoped by the same
  ``#since=&until=&cases=`` the Brief carries.
* ``cases.html`` -- **the Cases page**: one row per case with its last
  ``STRIP_RUNS`` presubmit outcomes, its 7- and 30-day pass rates per tier,
  its roster status and its last failure; ``#<case>`` lands on the row.
* ``nightly.html[#build=<prow build id>]`` -- **the Nightly report**: last
  night's run of the nightly tier (or the night ``build`` names), its cases
  by domain with pass / partial / fail and the grader's reason, what is
  newly failing against the night before, the wall clock and whether the
  night was cut short (``nightly.py``).
* ``trend.html[#cases=a,b|domain=<domain>][&metric=<judged metric>][&since=<ISO>]``
  -- **the Trend page**: scores over time on ``main``, read from the
  evidence store (``--store``, the ``store.json`` ``store.py`` wrote): per
  case and per domain, the pass rate by night with the trailing admission
  window beside it, the judged quality by night with the spread the store
  can support, and the nights where the version key changed marked
  (``trend.py``). Without ``--store`` the page says the store was not read.
* ``brief.json`` -- what the six pages render from: the per-run
  classification, the per-case record, the current health verdict, the
  incident history, the recent merges, the release-candidate runs and the
  nights on record. The trend block is ``trend.json`` beside it, polled by
  the Trend page alone (every page polls brief.json, and the block grows
  every night). ``data.json`` is copied verbatim beside them, and
  ``store.json`` when one was given (the next refresh reads it back as
  ``store.py --prior``, so a tick fetches only the objects it has not
  seen).

Every page is rendered in the browser (``template/page.html.tmpl`` +
``template/pages.js``) from the brief.json document inlined into it as
``<script type="application/json" id="inline-brief">`` (the verdict it read
again as ``inline-health``), so a page needs no request beyond itself; the
60-second poll of the published ``brief.json`` and ``health.json`` is a
best-effort refresh on top, and a host that answers an XHR with a login
redirect (storage.cloud.google.com does) just leaves the inlined data on
screen. ``--public-url`` adds ``<base href>`` so every relative link
resolves to the published site wherever the browser landed after that
redirect. Every time the pages show is America/Toronto, formatted there.
The optional inputs are ``health.json`` (the CI health adjudicator's
verdict, published beside data.json; nothing here writes it),
``health-history.jsonl`` (one health.json document per line plus a ``tick``
stamp), ``case-notes.yaml`` (``--notes``: a one-line note and issue links
per case) and ``events.yaml`` (``--events``: the human-annotated catch
counts). Without any of them the pages show what the runs alone support,
never an error.

Two rules shape everything here:

* **INFRA is not failure.** A rep (or task) whose result is ``infra`` is
  excluded from every pass-fraction denominator, matching the suite's policy
  that infrastructure failures never count against a PR.
* **Run-level events are charged to the run, not the cases.** A run where at
  least ``RUN_EVENT_FAIL_FRACTION`` of its graded tasks failed (a broken PR,
  an endpoint outage) keeps its cells on the Grid and its bars on a case's
  strip, but its failures are excluded from the per-case pass rates.

The reader contract is schema_version 1 of the collector's data.json.
Optional fields may be absent and unknown additive fields are ignored, so
this renderer and the collector can ship independently. In particular
``tasks[].reps``, ``runs[].tier``, ``runs[].pr_merged``, ``pending_builds``
and ``releases[]`` are optional additive fields (SCHEMA.md); without them
every task falls back to its single ``result``, every run is the
presubmit's, and the Grid has no "still running" columns and the Brief no
release table.

Only stdlib + PyYAML (already in requirements-test.txt) -- no build step.
