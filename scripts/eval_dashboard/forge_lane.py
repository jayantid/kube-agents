"""The ``gitlab`` block of brief.json: the GitLab lane's last runs.

The lane (``pull-kube-agents-smoke-test-gitlab``, kube-agents#2394) is the
presubmit's matrix driven against a pool project's GitLab repository. Its
runs carry ``tier: gitlab`` (tiers.py) and so reach no gate verdict, no case
history and no digest number; this block is where they are seen at all: the
newest ``RUNS_LISTED`` runs with Prow's result, the eval's own verdict, how
many cases passed, and a Spyglass link, plus the lane's builds still in
flight. Only stdlib, like the sibling nightly.py.
