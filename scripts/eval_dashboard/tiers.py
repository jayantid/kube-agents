"""Which tier a data.json run belongs to, and the filters every consumer uses.

The collector records three kinds of run under one schema (SCHEMA.md,
``runs[].tier``): the presubmit gate's, one per pull-request build of
``pull-kube-agents-smoke-test``; the nightly periodics', one per build of
``ci-kube-agents-eval-nightly`` (and of ``ci-kube-agents-eval-nightly-writers``
when a night is split across two jobs, ``nightly.py``) against ``main`` with
no pull request; and the GitLab lane's, one per build of
``pull-kube-agents-smoke-test-gitlab``, the same matrix driven against a pool
project's GitLab repository (``EVAL_FORGE=gitlab``, kube-agents#2394). Every
gate verdict -- the health adjudicator's rules, the "is this red mine?"
classification, the Brief's runs list -- is a statement about the presubmit,
so each of those consumers filters through ``presubmit_runs`` before it
counts anything; the GitLab lane is listed on its own and counts nowhere else. A document written before the field existed carries no
``tier`` at all; that is the presubmit, because nothing else was collected
then. A value this module does not know is no tier of these: a producer that
tags runs some new way must not have them counted as the gate's by default.

Only stdlib, so the consumers that avoid dependencies can import it.
