"""Comment on a pull request whose smoke-gate run went red: what failed, and
whether it is the gate's or the pull request's.

The gate's own status says "failed" and nothing else; the author then opens
a two-hour build log to learn whether the crashloop trio that redded them
is the same trio redding everyone (#1278) or their own ImagePullBackOff.
This is the health job answering that on the pull request itself, every
tick, for the runs that finished since the last tick:

    ### ❌ Smoke gate: failed · 3 of 14 cases
    > 🔴 Gate outage in progress since Sun 7:30 AM ET. ... not your code.
    | Case | Result | Also failing on |
    11 cases passed. Run 132 min on evals-23 · build log

Which runs: pull-kube-agents-smoke-test builds in data.json that finished
after the state file's `last_comment_tick` (data.json's horizon at the last
tick, minus a short overlap), concluded FAILURE, and graded at least one
repetition -- so an aborted run, a setup death, or a suite that
lost every repetition to a storm gets no comment (the Chat space and the
dashboard carry those). A red is either a gate case failing every graded
repetition, or a hard failure: FAILURE with no such case, which is an
absolute check (a forbidden cluster change, a verifier that errored) or a
truncated log, and says so. The nightly periodic's runs share data.json
(`tier: nightly`, no pull request) and are dropped before anything is
counted, so a green night never reads as another PR's pass (tiers.py).

Two shapes the red comment does not cover get one of their own. A lost pod -- the
build node went away under the job (health.py rule 3b, #1478): twelve
authors saw a red with no log and no explanation on 2026-09-11, so the
comment is one line saying the node died, nothing was graded, and to
/retest, with the same marker, edit-in-place and per-build dedupe as the
red comment:

    ### ⚪ Smoke gate: run lost
    > The Prow build node running this job went away at 10:19 AM ET (...).

And a deadline kill -- Prow ended the run at the job timeout with no
verdict (rule 3d, #1894), tasks or not: one line saying when, and -- while
health.json's condition is deadline_kill -- that the gate is down and the
red is not the author's diff:

    ### ⚪ Smoke gate: run killed at the deadline
    > Prow killed this run at its 360-minute deadline at 10:19 AM ET; ...

A run the suite itself could not evaluate (`runs[].eval_outcome`,
SCHEMA.md: an admitted case, or every case, lost every repetition to
infrastructure, so the job exited 2) is not a red either, whatever Prow's
FAILURE and the final line's `Failed` word say: `is_red` is false for it,
and it gets the same one-line shape naming the cases the suite listed in
`runs[].not_evaluated`, that nothing was graded for them, that nothing
about the change is implied, and to retest once the environment is healthy:

    ### ⚪ Smoke gate: run not evaluated
    > `security-overgrant-probe` lost every repetition to infrastructure ...

Which words: classify.py's `classify_run` -- the same rules the dashboard's
run.html and the incident brief use -- decides per case whether it is
`shared` (the gate's), `only-this-pr` (yours), `storm`, `delegation-ceiling`
(the harness's wait, nothing graded) or unexplained; this module only phrases
it.

One comment per pull request, found by a hidden marker and edited in place
on later runs; a build already commented on is never commented on twice.
Posting is `gh api` with the workflow's GITHUB_TOKEN (ghcli.py); a failure
is a warning and that run is retried next tick, and nothing here fails the
job.
