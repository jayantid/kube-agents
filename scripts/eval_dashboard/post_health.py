"""Post the gate's health to Google Chat -- on state changes, plus one digest a day.

health.py decides GREEN / DEGRADED / OUTAGE every tick; this is the half that
tells people, and its whole design is about NOT telling them most of the
time. It reads the current health.json and the state it last posted, and
sends a message only when:

    the state changed                       -> "CI health: DEGRADED (was GREEN)"
    the state returned to GREEN             -> the recovery, with how long it lasted
    an OUTAGE grew to name a new case       -> the same shape, rate-limited
    it is the digest hour and none went out -> the daily digest with the 24h numbers,
                                               plus one line on last night's
                                               nightly run when --data is given

Everything else is silence. The last-posted state lives in a small JSON file
(`--state`, a local path or a gs:// object) that this script is the only
writer of; the scheduled job is otherwise stateless.

A fourth message, rarer than the others: when health.json reports that
data.json itself has stopped refreshing (`stale`), the space is told once,
and once more when it resumes -- a silent stall would otherwise freeze the
state and keep the digest reporting old numbers as current. A fifth and a
sixth, of the same shape: when the hourly seeded-fleet scan could check no pool project
at all (health.json's `fixture_state.unknown`, the bot's grant missing), the
space is told once, and once more when the scan sees the fleet again. That
is never a drift. The digest carries one line on the latest scan. The
pool-state scan (`pool_state.unknown`, #1967) is told the same way.

A seventh, one line and once per episode: when health.json carries a `slow`
note (the gate's green runs are taking far longer than usual, #1586), the
space hears it the first tick it appears and not again until it has cleared
and come back; the digest repeats the line while it lasts. It is not a state
change -- nothing is broken and /retest does not help -- so it moves nothing
else. An eighth pair, the pool note: once when the pool-pressure periodic
reports runs waiting to be scheduled and once when they stop (KIND_POOL,
KIND_POOL_CLEAR). A ninth pair, the watched Prow periodics (KIND_PERIODIC,
KIND_PERIODIC_CLEAR): a failed run or a stopped job once per episode and
verdict, and once when a told job passes again.

Every time a reader sees is on the reader's clock: America/Toronto, written
"7:30 AM ET", never UTC (the deep links and the state file keep ISO UTC).
The digest hour is a Toronto hour too, and "once a day" is a Toronto day.

One side effect beyond posting: on a new OUTAGE with no tracking issue --
none in case-notes.yaml, none open under the `presubmit-gate` label naming
the same cases -- gate_issue.py files one with the workflow's GitHub token
(`gh api`, GH_TOKEN), the "broken" message says "Tracking #NNN", and the
recovery comments on it. A new `lost_pods` condition (the build cluster lost
the nodes under running jobs, #1478) files one the same way, addressed to
the cluster owner, unless an open `presubmit-gate` issue already names the
lost nodes. A new `fixture_drift` condition (a seeded fixture out of its
designed state on two consecutive hourly scans or on three pool projects at
once, #1550) files one for the fleet owner the same way, unless an open
`presubmit-gate` issue already names the drifted roles. A new `pool_drift`
condition (#1967) files one for the pool owner, with the repair per project,
unless an open `presubmit-gate` issue's title names every finding. A new `deadline_kill`
OUTAGE (runs killed at the job timeout with no verdict, #1894) files one for
whoever owns the gate, unless an open `presubmit-gate` issue's title already
names the deadline kills. It never closes an issue. A GitHub failure is a warning: the message goes out with "no issue
yet" and the next change asks again.

Delivery is the Google Chat REST API with the job's service account acting
as a Chat app: POST https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/{space}/messages with an
OAuth token bearing the chat.bot scope (the workflow mints one with `gcloud
auth print-access-token --scopes=...` and passes it in CI_HEALTH_CHAT_TOKEN;
incoming webhooks are disabled org-wide). The space id comes from
CI_HEALTH_CHAT_SPACE (`spaces/XXXX`, not a secret). An incoming-webhook URL
in CI_HEALTH_CHAT_WEBHOOK is the optional alternative, used when the space
and token are not both present. Neither the token nor the webhook URL is
ever printed: a failure logs the HTTP status and nothing from the request.
With nothing configured the script says so and exits 0 -- the job must not
fail while the space is being set up.
