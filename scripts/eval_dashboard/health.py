"""Adjudicate the presubmit gate's health from the eval dashboard's data.json.

Every gate incident in the week of 2026-09-01 was diagnosed by hand with the
same mechanical procedure: open the dashboard, find the reds of the last few
hours, ask whether the same cases failed on unrelated pull requests (a shared
fixture broke -- #1278), whether the repetitions were lost to 429s and empty
records rather than graded (a quota storm -- #1225, #1097), whether runs
died before any task ran (setup failures), whether the build cluster lost
the node the pod was on (lost pods -- #1478), or whether Prow killed the
runs at the job deadline with nothing graded (deadline kills -- #1894).
Nobody derives that from a heatmap at 8am, so this turns the procedure into
a job.

It is a pure function: data.json (schema v1, SCHEMA.md) plus the previously
written health.json in -- and, when the hourly scans have published them,
fixture-state.json (scripts/eval_dashboard/fixture_state.py) and
pool-state.json (scripts/eval_dashboard/pool_state.py), and the watched
periodics' readings (`--periodics-dir`, scripts/eval_dashboard/periodics.py)
-- health.json out (abridged; SCHEMA.md has every key)::

    {state, since, cause, failing_cases, evidence, advice, slow, pool,
     fixture_state, pool_state, periodics, periodics_read, periodics_runs,
     periodics_streaks, periodics_since,
     metrics, generated_at}

`state` is GREEN, DEGRADED or OUTAGE. The rules are the module-level
constants below -- each names the incident it was tuned on -- and the state
machine that applies hysteresis to them is `transition`. The previous state
is an input (`--prev`) rather than something remembered, so the scheduled
job that runs this is stateless between ticks. `slow` and `pool` are the
findings that are not states: green runs taking far longer than usual
(rule 7, #1586), and runs waiting in a queue before they start (rule 8,
#1607, read from the pool-pressure periodic's artifact rather than measured
here). The poster sends each once and the Brief shows them, while the state
stays what the rules above say.

The credibility test is the replay: `--replay` walks a data.json as if the
job had run every `--step` and prints the state timeline, and
scripts/test_eval_dashboard_health.py asserts that timeline against the
incidents the eval crew filed that week (fixture: testdata_health/, written
by `--trim`, which reduces a data.json to the runs of a date range and the
fields read here).

Time has two clocks. Every window is measured from the data's horizon --
its `generated_at`, the newest moment the collector saw -- because that is
when the evidence stops, not when this runs. The wall clock only asks how
old that horizon is: a data.json the refresh job has stopped updating would
otherwise freeze the state forever, so past `stale_after_s` health.json
says so (`stale`) and the poster tells the space.

Run:  python3 scripts/eval_dashboard/health.py --data data.json --prev health.json --out health.json
      python3 scripts/eval_dashboard/health.py --replay --data data.json --step 30m
Test: cd scripts && python3 -m unittest test_eval_dashboard_health

# Incident: after the 2026-09-06/07 weekend GKE node upgrade, seeded-a's
# e2-medium node was 100% CPU-requested by system pods, payments-api sat
# Pending on all 30 pool projects, and the crashloop trio
# (cluster-agent-crashloop-debug / -misleading-symptom / -evidence-chain)
# redded every pull request. #1171 and #1189 (2026-09-02) are the same shape
# one week earlier: compliance-rbac-overgrant and rca-remediation-pr
# collapsing on unrelated pull requests.
#
# The rule: within SHARED_BREAK_WINDOW the same admitted case failed all of
# its graded repetitions on at least SHARED_BREAK_MIN_RUNS runs from at least
# SHARED_BREAK_MIN_PRS distinct pull requests, and the set of such cases
# explains at least SHARED_BREAK_MAJORITY of the red runs in the window.
# Admitted matters: only a BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED case reds a pull request on a
# graded failure, so a hold-out collapsing is a case problem, not a gate
# outage. Three distinct pull requests is what separates "the fixture broke"
# from "one branch broke it" -- rule 4 below is the one-PR complement.
#
# SHARED_BREAK_MIN_RED_SHARE is a tuning from the replay: the reds also have
# to be at least half of the window's concluded runs. Without it the tail of
# the 2026-09-03 storm (2026-09-04 00:00-05:00Z) read as an OUTAGE -- the

# Incident: the Gemini API key's fixed token quota (#1208) saturates under a

# (#1225), repetitions come back as empty records ("no agent ever ran") or
# as KUBE_AGENTS_INFRA_FAILURE, and on 2026-09-03 thirteen repetitions of
# one build were lost that way while it stretched to five hours (#1214).
#
# The rule: STORM_MIN_REPS storm-classified repetitions across STORM_MIN_PRS
# distinct pull requests among the runs that finished inside STORM_WINDOW.
# A repetition is storm-classified when the harness graded it `infra`, or
# when its reason carries one of the harness's own never-ran phrasings
# (bench/kube_agents_bench/scoring.py) -- which before #1184 landed were
# graded `fail`, so the reason text is the only signal that survives in

# --- Rule 2b: delegation ceiling -> DEGRADED (#1874, #1879) -------------------
# Incident: the platform agent's kanban dispatcher stalls under load ("ready
# queue non-empty ... 0 workers spawned", 23 warnings on the 2026-09-21
# nightly, #1879), or workers run past the harness's wait. Every repetition
# that reaches AGENT_DELEGATION_TIMEOUT with nothing delivered is a `ceiling`
# rep (REP_CEILING above): not graded and not a storm rep, so on its own it
# is neither a collapse for rule 1 nor a count for rule 2, and the suite
# reports the run NOT EVALUATED. Without this rule a fleet-wide stall read
# GREEN here while every pull request was told to rerun: visible on each
# run, named nowhere.
#
# The rule is rule 2's shape over ceiling reps, same thresholds and window:
# CEILING_MIN_REPS across CEILING_MIN_PRS distinct pull requests among the
# runs that finished inside CEILING_WINDOW. Three PRs because one project's
# worker can be slow on one PR's task without saying anything about the
# fleet; fifteen reps because one or two per run is a slow worker on a slow
# day, while five per run three times over is the 2026-09-19 nightly's shape
# (13 of 116) spread across presubmits. Ranked below the storm on purpose: a
# 429-starved worker hits the same wait, so when both fire the quota is the
# cause and the ceiling wave is evidence beside it.

# --- Rule 3: setup deaths -> DEGRADED (#1172, #1176) -------------------------
# Incident: a stuck Helm release record left by ci-teardown poisoned pool
# projects, and the next pull request to lease one died at deploy with
# "UPGRADE FAILED, no deployed releases" before a single task ran.
#
# The rule: runs that recorded zero tasks, concluded FAILURE (an ABORTED
# zero-task run is a superseded push, #1179) and lasted under
# SETUP_DEATH_MAX_DURATION -- SETUP_DEATH_MIN of them inside
# SETUP_DEATH_WINDOW across SETUP_DEATH_MIN_PRS distinct pull requests. The
# distinct-PR floor is a tuning from the replay: on 2026-09-01 08:00Z one
# pull request (#1068) died seven times in an hour on its own merge
# conflict, which is that branch's problem and not the gate's. A run the

# Incident: on 2026-09-11 14:03-14:17Z five nodes of the Prow build cluster
# went NotReady and twelve runs on twelve pull requests died mid-run, some of
# them two hours in. Each left finished.json (`failure`), a podinfo.json
# whose last event is NodeNotReady, and no build-log.txt; rule 3 saw the one
# that was under five minutes old and blamed the pool projects.
#
# The rule: a run is a lost pod when it concluded FAILURE with no tasks and
# either its pod's last event was NodeNotReady or it has no build log
# (SCHEMA.md: runs[].pod_last_event, runs[].has_build_log; a run collected
# before those fields existed is unknown and never one). LOST_POD_MIN of them
# finishing within LOST_POD_SPAN of each other, among the runs that finished
# inside LOST_POD_WINDOW, is the condition; LOST_POD_EVENT_MIN of them is a
# build-cluster event and is announced as one. No distinct-PR floor: the pod
# record already says it was the node, not the branch. A lost pod is never
# also a setup death, whatever its duration -- each zero-task run is counted
# in exactly one class. Ranked above the storm because its evidence is the

# --- Rule 3d: deadline kills -> OUTAGE (#1894) -------------------------------
# Incident: from the evening of 2026-09-22 (UTC) the Hermes bump wedged the
# workers (#1880) and presubmit runs were killed at Prow's 360m deadline with
# every unit at the delegation ceiling and nothing graded -- 33 kills against
# 10 verdicts in the fixture's 32 hours -- and the bot stayed GREEN: a
# deadline death after a successful deploy matched no rule.
#
# The rule: a run is a deadline kill when it concluded FAILURE with no eval
# verdict, is neither a lost pod nor a conflicted merge, and lasted at least
# PROW_JOB_TIMEOUT minus DEADLINE_KILL_MARGIN. Not "no tasks": since #1875 the
# harness records cases as they finish, so a killed run may carry graded
# tasks and still no verdict. DEADLINE_KILL_MIN of them finishing inside
# DEADLINE_KILL_WINDOW on DEADLINE_KILL_MIN_PRS distinct pull requests is an
# OUTAGE -- the gate can pass nobody -- ranked below a shared break, which
# names cases, and above every DEGRADED condition. Recovery is
# RECOVERY_GREEN_RUNS runs WITH A VERDICT, green or red, on distinct pull
# requests after the last kill: a red that graded proves the gate grades.
#
# The timeout is the job's decoration_config.timeout in oss-test-infra
# (prow/prowjobs/gke-labs/kube-agents/kube-agents-presubmits.yaml); data.json

# --- Rule 3c: fixture drift -> DEGRADED (#1550, #1544) -----------------------
# Incident: #1278 again, seen from the fleet's side. The presence probes kept
# passing while every slot-a fixture sat Pending; the designed-state check
# (hack/fleet-fixture-state.py) is what would have said so, and the CI health
# workflow now runs it against every pool project once an hour and publishes
# fixture-state.json beside health.json (scripts/eval_dashboard/
# fixture_state.py). Nothing in the presubmit runs this check and nothing
# acts on a drift (decision 2026-09-14: evals v1 detects, does not act), so a drifted role
# reds the cases that depend on it on the runs that lease those projects;
# the run-based rules above see that red as it happens, and this rule names
# the cause and its owner (the fleet's reconcile). DEGRADED, not an OUTAGE:
# it is a few cases on some projects, with the fix in someone's hands.
#
# The rule: the same role drifted on the same project in
# FIXTURE_DRIFT_CONSECUTIVE_SCANS consecutive scans, or on
# FIXTURE_DRIFT_MIN_PROJECTS projects in one scan. One scan on one project is
# not enough: in #1278's retest sweep the crashloop fixture lagged the node
# repair by about 40 minutes on one project (it needs its first restart
# before OOMKilled evidence exists), and one hourly scan can land inside that
# window; the second scan is an hour later. Three projects at once is the
# fleet-wide shape (#1278 was all 30) and waits for nothing. A scan older than
# FIXTURE_STATE_MAX_AGE (three missed hourly scans) is the scan job being
# broken, not the fleet, and is ignored with a note. A scan that could check
# no project at all (the bot's grant missing) is `unknown`: said once by the

# finished after the incident began and none carrying the signature of the
# condition being left -- a single lucky green does not declare victory, and
# the runs that made the incident cannot end it (#1213 is the false-green

# --- Rule 7: slow gate -> a note beside the state, never a state (#1586) ------
# Incident: on 2026-09-14 Vertex latency (per call p90 21 s, p99 84 s in a
# sampled run; every 429 retried successfully) stretched full runs from a
# typical 150 minutes to 175-215 while all of them stayed green. Rules 1-3b
# see nothing: no repetition was lost, no case was shared, and the 23 runs in
# flight never reach this module, which reads finished runs only. So the
# slowness is a note in health.json (`slow`), posted once per episode and
# shown on the Brief, and the state stays whatever the rules say: nothing is
# broken and /retest does not help.
#
# The rule: the median wall clock of the newest SLOW_RUNS full runs -- a
# concluded run of at least SLOW_MIN_TASKS cases (one fewer than the
# presubmit file lists, read from hack/eval/presubmit-cases.txt: 13 for the
# fourteen the presubmit runs since 2026-09-29 (twelve on the roster plus the
# two held-out seats, the compliance canary, #2013, and pdb-remediation-pr,
# #2016; twelve from 2026-09-22, when it became the
# blocking roster only, #1023, having run 18-19 before); a run Prow cut short
# at its ceiling recorded fewer and is not one; the floor was a literal 15
# until the roster shrank under it, which would have made every run since a
# partial one and the rule silent, so it follows the file and sits one
# demotion below the roster on purpose, an admission or a demotion moving
# it without an edit here) -- all of
# them finished inside SLOW_WINDOW, is at least SLOW_FACTOR times the median
# of the full runs of the trailing SLOW_BASELINE before them, given at least
# SLOW_BASELINE_MIN_RUNS of those. Medians rather than the p90 the issue
# proposed: replayed over the published data.json, "three consecutive runs
# above the seven-day p90" never fired on 2026-09-14 (the p90 stood at 198
# minutes because 09-08 to 09-11 had been slow too, and 3 of the day's 12
# finished runs cleared it), while the 1.2x median fired from 18:00Z and
# stayed quiet over 09-06 to 09-09 and the 09-12/13 weekend. Once slow, the
