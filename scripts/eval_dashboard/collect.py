"""Collect eval smoke-test runs from Prow build logs into data.json.

The presubmit (hack/ci-eval-pr.sh, run by pull-kube-agents-smoke-test) prints
one `Task <name> Result:` line per bench case and a final verdict line, and
Prow archives the whole thing as build-log.txt next to started.json and
finished.json under gs://kube-agents-prow. Nothing structured survives the
run, so this collector re-derives structure from those lines and writes the
data.json the dashboard renders.

data.json is a CONTRACT: the renderer and the publisher are built against the
exact shape documented in SCHEMA.md. Changes must be additive optional fields
only, with schema_version bumped on anything else. The additive fields this
collector emits beyond the v1 core: `tasks[].reps` (per-repetition grading
detail, present only when the log carries `rep N:` grading lines),
`runs[].pr_merged` (whether the run's PR had merged at collection time,
resolved best-effort through `gh`), `runs[].tier` / `runs[].job` (which job
produced the run: the presubmit gate, or the nightly periodic below),
`runs[].has_build_log` plus the `runs[].pod_*` trio (how the build ended,
from Prow's podinfo.json -- read only for a build that looks like a lost
pod, below), `runs[].merge_conflict` (below) and `releases[]`
(release-candidate eval runs, below).

Two tiers, one schema. The presubmit (pull-kube-agents-smoke-test) runs the
gate matrix on every pull request; the nightly periodic
(ci-kube-agents-eval-nightly, EVAL_TIER=nightly in the same script) runs the
full catalogue against main once a day, with no pull request. Both archive
the same artifact layout, so both parse through build_run; the tier travels
on the run so every consumer can keep the nightly out of the gate's verdicts
(tiers.py). Prow's build ids are one global, start-ordered sequence, so the
newest presubmit id sits far above every nightly id and a shared watermark
would skip every night: each source keeps its own.

A build whose node went NotReady mid-run (2026-09-11: twelve runs on five
nodes, #1478) leaves finished.json (`failure`), podinfo.json and no
build-log.txt at all; it lands here as a zero-task FAILURE of any duration
and is indistinguishable from a clone failure without the pod's last event.
So when a build has no build log, or concluded FAILURE with no tasks,
podinfo.json is read as well -- one extra object per such build, none for a
build that ran -- and the pod's phase, node and last event are recorded.

A pull request that will not merge into main leaves the same zero-task
FAILURE (2026-09-15: #1569, #1572, #1575, reported as an infrastructure
degradation; #1608). clone-records.json is read for those builds too, and
`merge_conflict` says which of the two it was.

Release candidates are collected separately and land in `releases[]`, never
in `runs[]`. post-kube-agents-eval-rc drives the same hack/ci-eval-pr.sh, so
its build log parses identically -- but a candidate is judged against main's
window rather than added to it (hack/ci-eval-pr.sh:1998: "the baseline store
is read, never written"), and folding an RC into runs[] would feed it to
build_cases and move the pass rates the candidate is being measured against.

Sources:
  --nightly-prefix  Prow's log prefix for the nightly periodic,
              gs://<bucket>/logs/<job>/: for a periodic that prefix IS the
              directory index -- one directory per build plus a
              `latest-build.txt` this collector ignores -- so one `gsutil
              ls` of it names every build. Given without a value it is the
              live nightly's prefix (DEFAULT_NIGHTLY_PREFIX); omitted, no
              nightly scan happens. A prefix that does not list is read
              three ways. One that holds no objects (gsutil: "matched no
              objects") is a job that has not run there yet -- before its
              first night, or after its bucket moved -- and is a note and
              no nightly runs this scan whether or not a night is on
              record, not the refusal line below: the nightly is evidence
              beside the gate, and a missing night must not stop the gate's
              dashboard from publishing (a prefix emptied or mistyped reads
              the same way, and shows as "no night" on the digest and the
              Nightly page instead). Any other failure with no night on
              record is the same note. Once a night is on record, any other
              failure IS the refusal line: a stall, not an absent job.
  --nightly-job  the job name recorded on nightly runs (`runs[].job`);
              defaults to the prefix's last path segment.
  --index-prefix  Prow's per-job directory index, gs://<bucket>/pr-logs/
              directory/<job>/: one small `<build_id>.txt` object per build
              holding the gs:// path of that build's directory (plus a
              `latest-build.txt` this collector ignores). One `gsutil ls`
              of the prefix names every build the job ever ran in seconds,
              however many PRs the archive spans, so this is how an
              incremental scan discovers what is new: list the index once,
              keep the ids above the watermark, read those pointers, then
              read the builds. Defaults to the index derived from each
              --pr-glob's bucket and job; an empty string disables it. It
              changes how a --pr-glob scan discovers builds, not whether
              one happens: --pr-glob is still what asks for a GCS scan, and
              --merge-with alone still recomputes without touching the
              bucket.
  --pr-glob   gsutil glob(s) of Prow build directories (read-only; requires
              gsutil on PATH). Repeatable. One `gsutil ls` of a whole-archive
              glob walks every PR directory and grows with the archive (past
              the per-call timeout at ~1700 builds), so the glob itself is
              listed only for a cold sweep -- no watermark; with a watermark
              the index above is listed instead.
  --from-dir  a local directory whose immediate subdirectories each hold a
              build's build-log.txt / started.json / finished.json -- the
              offline path the unit tests use.
  --rc-glob / --rc-from-dir
              the same two shapes, for the release-candidate job. Bounded to
              the newest --rc-limit builds rather than by a watermark: RC
              runs are cut per staging promotion, so there are few of them.
              --merge-with still applies -- a recorded release is final, so
              the prior file's releases are carried forward and only the
              build ids it does not cover are read.

Incremental mode (what the 15-minute refresh job runs):
  --merge-with  a previously written data.json (local path or gs:// URL).
              Its runs are carried over verbatim, the GCS scan skips every
              build at or below the newest build id already on record, and
              cases/coverage are recomputed from the merged run list. The
              cold sweep is ~3 gsutil calls per archived build (READ_WORKERS
              at a time) -- tens of minutes over two weeks of history -- so
              a periodic job MUST ride this watermark. Prow build ids are
              monotonic in START order, not finish order, so a build still
              in flight when a later, shorter build gets recorded would sit
              below the watermark forever; the prior file's pending_builds
              list is how those get back in: every listed-but-unrecorded
              build rides it and is re-read on the next scan regardless of
              the watermark, until it finishes or PENDING_RETRY_DAYS passes.
              A missing, unreadable or implausible prior file is a warning
              that degrades to a fresh sweep bounded by --since-days
              (default 14 in that case), never a crash: the first armed
              run has no prior file at all.
  --since-days  skip GCS builds whose started.json is older than N days.
              Costs one probe read per candidate build and saves the other
              two; the watermark filter above is free and runs first.

A failed or timed-out listing -- index or glob -- is a `warning: gsutil ls
... failed` line and an otherwise well-formed document with nothing new;
the refresh workflow greps for that line and refuses to publish, so a
stalled archive is never republished under a fresh generated_at.

Builds with no finished.json are still running (or never finished uploading)
and are skipped. Everything else is parsed best-effort: a truncated log
yields a partial run, an unparseable build is skipped with a warning, and a
task name with no bench/tasks/<name>/task.yaml on the current checkout (a
historical, since-renamed case) gets domain "unknown" rather than a crash.

    the `warning: gsutil ls ... failed` line the refresh workflow refuses
    on. Any other failure with no nightly on record (no watermark) is the
    same note: the job may simply not exist yet. Once a night IS on record,

    the bucket or the grant failing, and republishing would freeze the
