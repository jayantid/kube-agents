"""Classify one smoke-test run: which of its failures are the gate's and
which are the pull request's.

The gate comment on a pull request, the dashboard's PR view
(``run.html#build=<id>``) and the incident brief all answer the same
question about a red run -- "is this mine?" -- and they must answer it the
same way, so the rules live here once. ``classify_run`` is the whole
interface::

    classify_run(run, runs, health_at=None, now=None, admitted=None) -> {
        "build": str, "pr": int|None, "headline": str, "lede": str,
        "verdict": "red" | "green" | "infra" | "not_evaluated",
        "cases": [{"case", "outcome", "cls", "also_failing_prs",
                   "pass_rate_30d", "reason", "excerpt", "rep_n", "do",
                   "admitted", "reps"}],
        "matches_incident": bool,
        # run-level detail: "setup_death", "storm_reps", "ceiling_reps", "cls",
        # "do", "not_evaluated"
    }

The first line of keys is the contract other callers rely on; the rest is
additive detail the pages show.

``run`` and ``runs`` are data.json shapes (SCHEMA.md); ``health_at`` is the
health.json document in force when the run finished (state, condition,
failing_cases are read; anything else is ignored); ``now`` anchors the
30-day pass rate and defaults to the run's finish. Every rule below is a
module constant with the incident it was tuned on; the vocabulary
(``shared_break`` / ``storm`` / ``setup_deaths`` / ``lost_pods``, storm-classified
repetitions, collapsed cases) is the CI health adjudicator's, restated here
so this module has no dependency beyond the standard library.

Per failed admitted case, in priority order:

* ``shared`` -- the same case failed every graded repetition on runs of at
  least SHARED_MIN_OTHER_PRS other pull requests that finished inside
  [start - SHARED_WINDOW_BEFORE, finish], or the health verdict names it.
  The 2026-09-07/08 crashloop outage (#1269, #1278) is the shape.
* ``storm`` -- the run lost at least STORM_RUN_SIGNATURE_REPS repetitions
  to 429s or empty records, or the verdict says storm (#1225, #1214).
* ``only-this-pr`` -- the case passed on the last ONLY_PR_MIN_OTHER_RUNS
  runs of other pull requests inside ONLY_PR_WINDOW and failed here.
* ``None`` -- nothing above fits; the page says it cannot tell.

An ungraded case (outcome ``infra``) is ``storm`` under the same storm
tests, or ``delegation-ceiling`` when every one of its ungraded repetitions
carries the scorer's DELEGATION_CEILING_MARKER: the harness's delegation
wait ran out with the worker still running (#1874). Ceiling repetitions
are outside the storm count and every pass-rate denominator.

``setup`` is a run-level class: no tasks, a FAILURE verdict, under
SETUP_DEATH_MAX_DURATION (#1172). A lost pod -- the same zero-task FAILURE
at any duration, with a NodeNotReady pod event or no build log at all
(``is_lost_pod``, #1478) -- shares the class with its own headline and
``do``. A conflicted merge (``is_merge_conflict``, #1608) is the same shape
again and is neither: it is the branch's own, so it is ``red`` and the
``do`` is a rebase rather than a retest. None of the three has cases to
classify. ``deadline-kill`` (``is_deadline_kill``, #1894) is the fourth
run-level class -- a FAILURE with no eval verdict that ran to the job's
timeout -- and the one that may carry cases: the harness records each case
as it finishes (#1875), so the cases graded before Prow stopped the run are
classified and shown, under the kill's headline and ``do``.

``not_evaluated`` is a verdict of its own, and the only one the run brings
with it: the suite itself said so (``runs[].eval_outcome``, SCHEMA.md --
an admitted case, or every case, lost every repetition to infrastructure,
so the job exited 2 and could certify nothing). It is read before every
rule above and is never folded into ``red`` or ``infra``: red would send
the author to a build log for an absolute check that did not trip, and
infra would count it among the gate's failures when nothing was graded.
The cases are still classified, so the page can list what was lost -- and
so a gate case that failed every graded repetition on the same run is
named in the lede: the suite's roster is the branch's and the dashboard's
can be newer, so the suite may not have counted it. The verdict stays the
suite's; the author is told what to read before retesting.

``runs`` may carry the nightly periodic's runs beside the presubmit's
(SCHEMA.md: ``runs[].tier``; ``tiers.py``). Every rule above reads the
presubmit only: a nightly has no pull request, so it is never "another PR"
for the shared rule, never one of the passes the only-this-PR rule needs,
and never in the 30-day pass rate. What it is good for is separate and
additive: ``nightly_failed_recent`` per case says whether the newest
nightly run inside NIGHTLY_RECENT_WINDOW of this run also failed the case
outright -- evidence the case is broken on main, which is the reader's
next question after "is this mine?".

Only stdlib, plus the sibling ``tiers`` module.
