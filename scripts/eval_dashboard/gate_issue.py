"""File the tracking issue a new OUTAGE lacks -- or the one a build-cluster
event owes its cluster owner -- and tell it when the gate recovers.

Every shared break in the week of 2026-09-01 got an issue eventually -- #1171,
#1189, #1269, #1278 -- but hours after the first red, and the Chat message
meanwhile said "no issue yet, file one". This is the bot filing it:

    the state becomes OUTAGE
    and health.json names no tracking issue (case-notes.yaml has none)
    and no OPEN issue labelled `presubmit-gate` already names the same cases
    -> create one, labelled `presubmit-gate`, and say "Tracking #NNN"

The second shape (#1478): on 2026-09-11 five nodes of the Prow build cluster
went NotReady and twelve runs died mid-run; nobody owning the cluster was
told. So:

    the condition becomes `lost_pods`
    and no OPEN issue labelled `presubmit-gate` already names every lost node
    -> create one addressed to the cluster owner, and say "Tracking #NNN"

The third shape (#1550): the hourly seeded-fleet scan finds a fixture role out
of its designed state on the same project two scans running, or on three
projects at once, and every case depending on it reds on the runs that
lease those projects. So:

    the condition becomes `fixture_drift`
    and no OPEN issue labelled `presubmit-gate` already names every drifted role
    -> create one addressed to the fleet owner, and say "Tracking #NNN"

The fourth shape (#1894): runs Prow killed at the job deadline with no
verdict, 3+ on 2+ pull requests in 2 hours, so nothing is graded and nobody
can pass. So:

    the condition becomes `deadline_kill`
    and no OPEN issue labelled `presubmit-gate` has "deadline" and "smoke" in its TITLE
    -> create one for whoever owns the gate, and say "Tracking #NNN"

The fifth shape (#1967): the hourly pool-state scan finds the same finding on
the same pool project two scans running, or on three projects at once. So:

    the condition becomes `pool_drift`
    and no OPEN issue labelled `presubmit-gate` has every finding id in its TITLE
    -> create one for the pool owner, with the repair per project

The dedupe is against people: a human who filed first, with the case names
(or the node names, or the role names) in the title or body -- or, for the
deadline kills and the pool findings, in the title -- wins and the bot adopts
their issue. A recovery gets one comment ("Healthy again after Xh; bot will not
close it"). The bot never closes an issue -- a green gate is not proof the
fixture is fixed, only that three runs passed, and the node events are still
worth reading after the pool has healed itself.

All GitHub traffic goes through ghcli.Gh (`gh api`, the workflow's token),
best-effort: a failure leaves the message at "no issue yet" and the next
change asks again. post_health.py owns when this is called; this module
owns what the issue says.
