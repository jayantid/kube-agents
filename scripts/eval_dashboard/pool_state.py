"""Scan every CI pool project's shape for drift, on the health bot's clock.

A pool project is verified once, by hand, at onboarding
(scripts/verify_ci_pool_project.py, docs/ci-pool-projects.md section 7) and
never again, so when the verifier's bundle changes or a project drifts the
first signal is a 403 in an agent transcript on whichever pull request leased
it. roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer joined the platform GSA's bundle
on 2026-09-08 and was missing on all 30 projects until 2026-09-23 (#1927).
This is the detector #1967 asks for, built the way the seeded-fleet scan is
(fixture_state.py): the check lives in one place, the hourly job runs it, the
document is published beside fixture-state.json, and health.py turns it into
a DEGRADED condition with a tracking issue that carries the repair command.
It asserts; it never grants, revokes or deletes.

Per project, in a temporary directory of its own:

    scripts/verify_ci_pool_project.py --project-id <p> --checks <read-only set> --report <file>

The checks are the verifier's POOL_STATE_CHECKS: the project and its APIs,
IAM, Artifact Registry, the clusters and state bucket, and the KMS half of
the token minter. Every read runs as the bot itself
(eval-dashboard-publisher@kube-agents-prow), which needs the project-level
read roles bench/tf/fleet grants it (`pool_state_readers`); a project without
them scans as "not checked" with gcloud's own words. Not run here: the fleet
fixtures (fixture_state.py already does), the warm-cache reader grants in the
Prow project (warm_cache), the GitHub-reading checks (github_repo_and_app,
gitops_declaration, ledger_read_credential; each needs a credential the bot
must not hold), the minter check's signing half (token_minter; the scan runs
token_minter_kms), the mapping (about the checkout, not the project).

The project list is `gitops_repo_for_project()` in hack/ci-deploy.sh, read
the way fixture_state.py reads it. Nothing here fails the bot's run: a
missing gcloud, a verifier that timed out or could not be started, a project
the bot cannot read are each "not checked" with a reason, exit 0. Only a repository bug (no mapping,
no verifier) exits 1.

Run:  python3 scripts/eval_dashboard/pool_state.py --out pool-state.json [--prior pool-state.json]
Test: cd scripts && python3 -m unittest test_eval_dashboard_pool_state
