"""The Trend page's document: scores over time on ``main``, from the evidence store.

``store.py`` reads the store into ``store.json`` (one record per case per
night, as the nightly appended it); this module turns those records into
what ``trend.html`` draws and ``render.py`` puts into ``brief.json`` as
``trend`` (SCHEMA.md, "brief.json"): per case and per domain, the
deterministic pass rate by night and the judged quality by night, with the
nights where the version key changed marked, so a step change has its
explanation next to it (#1493).

WHAT "SCORE" MEANS is written once, in ``docs/designs/eval-scorer.md``
("What a score is"), and this module follows it:

* **Pass rate is the gate's number.** ``passes / runs`` over the scored
  repetitions of a record; ``blocked`` and ``infra`` repetitions stay out of
  the rate. Beside each night's own rate the page draws the **trailing
  window**: the newest whole records at the same key pooled until they hold
  ``ADMISSION_MIN_RUNS`` runs, which is what computed admission reads
  (``BaselineStore.evidence_for``). Admission pools with no date limit and
  this page reads a bounded span, so the read reaches ``lead_days`` past
  the drawn window (store.py) and the nights in that lead-in are pooled
  but not drawn; a window that is still short while the listing shows
  older objects at that key beyond the read (``older`` in store.json:
  older than the span, or trimmed by the cap) is marked ``cut`` and the
  page says so instead of "not full", so the line here and the record's
  verdict never disagree silently.
* **Judged quality is advisory and never a single point.** A record carries
  a mean and its ``n`` per metric and not the repetitions' own values, so
  the spread across repetitions is not in the store yet (an addition to the
  record; the design names it). What the page can show honestly is drawn
  instead: for a case, the range of its nightly means over the trailing
  ``SPREAD_NIGHTS`` nights at the same key (a band; a lone night has none and
  is drawn as one marked point with its ``n``); for a domain, the
  ``n``-weighted mean across its cases with the range of their means.

ONLY NIGHTLY RECORDS. The store holds what ran on ``main``: only the nightly
appends to it (a pull request's run is graded against it and never writes),
so a trend read from the store is the nightly's by construction; the
presubmit's judged scores stay on the run page.

THE VERSION KEY. Each record carries the five-component key it was measured
at (``setup_id``, ``scoring_version``, ``judge_model``, ``fleet``,
``verifiers``). Records are compared in time order per case; where the key
differs from the record before, that night is a marker naming the
components that changed. Pooling (the trailing window, the spread) never
crosses a key: a baseline measured on other software is not evidence about
this one.

Only stdlib, like ``nightly.py``.
