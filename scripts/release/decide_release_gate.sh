# produces the `should_release` verdict the publish job is gated on.
#
# A scheduled run has no human behind it, so the verdict comes from
# resolve_scheduled_release.sh. A manual dispatch does, and that human clicking
# "Run workflow" *is* the gate — so by default it short-circuits to `true`,
# emergency path included.
#
# The two remaining modes make the unattended verdict reachable on demand, which
# is the only way to see what the cron will decide without waiting a week for it
# to decide it:
#
#   bypass    (default) A human decided. Publishes.
#   dry-run   Run the resolver, report its verdict, publish nothing. What the
#             cron would do, with the consequences left off.
#   evaluate  Run the resolver and honour it. Exactly a cron tick, on demand.
#
# Defense-in-depth: in kube-agents, release-publish.yml is dispatch-only and the
# weekly cron lives decoupled on release-scheduler.yml. If a `schedule` event
# were ever configured directly here, the mode is forced to `evaluate` whatever
# the input says — ensuring an edited default cannot turn a cron tick into a dry run.
