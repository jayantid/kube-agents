# Rolls an installed environment back from the candidate to the previous GA
# release, checks the result, and rolls forward to the candidate again.
#
# This is the rollback runbook (docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/rollback.md)
# run by a machine: from a clean checkout of the GA tag, `upgrade.sh
# --upgrade-mode=operator` then `--upgrade-mode=harness`, both `--image-tag`
# that GA, and --drop-undeclared-values where the GA's script takes it. The
# roll-forward is the same pair from the candidate checkout, so one run
# exercises both directions between N-1 and N and leaves the environment on
# the candidate's images. A value the rollback dropped is not restored: the
# roll-forward renders it from the candidate chart's default.
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   CANDIDATE_SHA            The commit the environment runs now (N). Required.
#   ROLLBACK_TAG             The GA to roll back to (N-1). Default: the newest
#                            pure-numeric tag in this checkout.
#   ROLL_FORWARD             `false` to stop after the rollback. Default true.
#   KUBE_AGENTS_INSTALL_ENV  The install's install.env. When unset, one is
#                            rendered from the environment with
#                            render_install_env.sh (not --strict; see below).
#   ROLLBACK_MODE            `resolve` prints the tag it would roll back to and
#                            exits without touching anything.
#
# Outputs: a Markdown table in GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY and `diagnostics_dir` in
# GITHUB_OUTPUT. Exit 0 only when every step and every check passed.
