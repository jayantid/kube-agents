# Release scripts point kubectl at the RC cluster before doing anything to it,
# such as wait_for_gke_readiness.sh, resolving the target itself. The helpers live
# here rather than being duplicated, because the resolution order below is a
# contract with the workflows: GKE_CLUSTER_NAME/GCP_REGION/GCP_PROJECT_ID are what
# the `env:` blocks set, and CLUSTER_NAME/REGION/PROJECT_ID are the installer's own
# names, which a developer running these by hand after install.sh already has exported.
#
# Assigns to globals rather than echoing: a caller reading an echo would need
# command substitution, and a `set -u` abort inside a subshell would leave the
# variable empty and the script running against an unnamed target.
#
# None of the four get a default in CI. A pipeline that reaches here with
# GCP_PROJECT_ID unset has a misconfigured `env:` block or a variable missing
# from its GitHub environment; defaulting PROJECT_ID to kube-agents-rc there
# does not rescue the run, it points a real teardown-and-reinstall at a real
# project nobody named. Failing names the variable instead, at the first script
# that needs it rather than several steps later against a cluster that does not
# exist. The defaults stay for the developer path, which is what the
# CLUSTER_NAME/REGION/PROJECT_ID half of the contract above is for.
#
# AGENT_NAMESPACE is in the list because the `rc` and `nightly` environments
# both define it. A workflow that binds neither environment reaches here with
# all four empty and fails on the targeting trio regardless, so requiring the
# namespace costs those callers nothing — and a job that sets the other three
# but not this one is misconfigured in exactly the way silence used to hide,
# since `vars.AGENT_NAMESPACE` expanding to empty is indistinguishable from the

# verdict before pushing the staging_ tag below.
#
# WHY A SECOND TAG FAMILY AND NOT JUST staging_. The eval used to trigger on
# staging_, which is also what staging-deploy.yml triggers on: both fired off one
# push event, and the deploy — minutes — finished long before the eval — hours —
# had a verdict, so the verdict could only ever describe a deploy that had
# already happened. evalcand_ puts the eval between the two.
#
# WHAT READS IT. resolve_promotion_candidate.sh, and only it: a commit already
# carrying an evalcand_ tag has been answered about, so it skips. That makes the
# leftover tag on a rejected candidate the thing that keeps it rejected, rather
# than an inert marker — which is why drop_eval_candidate.sh exists for the runs
# where no verdict arrived at all. Every other tag reader here is prefix-scoped

# behind would be worse than either: get_latest_staging_tag would offer it to a

# any validated candidate, and the tag graph keeps every candidate it ever
# validated. Naming one by hand is a supported thing to do and stays wrong for
# the same reason it is wrong today.

# driving the candidate's tree in a way an older tree cannot answer — and not
# the general question of whether a tree can be driven by these workflows. Ten
# scripts run out of the candidate's checkout; these sample three. That is sound
# for the boundaries they were chosen for, because each arrived in the commit
# that created one. A later restructure that adds a seam needs its own marker
# here; this function will not notice on its own.
