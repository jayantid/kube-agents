# All three of GITOPS_ORG/GITOPS_REPO/GITHUB_APP_ID must be non-empty before
# installer_common.sh provisions the minter at all, and its own "GitHub minter
# deferred" warning only fires once they are, so one missing value skips the
# minter in silence.
#
# Nothing downstream catches it on the RC, which is why the check is here: the
# test that exercises minting runs in an optional, `continue-on-error` suite
# there, so a broken minter costs an HTTP 502 in a tolerated step and validates
# the candidate anyway. The nightly pipeline runs the same test in its blocking
# suite and needs no such help.
#
# Above the teardown deliberately. `teardown_run` below is `uninstall.sh`, so a
# check placed after it would refuse an environment it had already destroyed and
# leave it down until someone re-ran the pipeline.
#
# All three empty stays allowed: that is an install deliberately without a
# minter, which is the default outside the RC and nightly environments.
#
# Why a value goes missing is in scripts/release/README.md under "Enabling the
# GitHub token minter on the RC".
# The deprecated spellings, folded in before the guard rather than after it.
# installer_common.sh's normalize_gitops_repo_vars does the same thing for the
# installers, but this check runs before the repository's helpers are sourced --
# and a half-configured minter passed under the old names has to be caught here
# too, or the deprecation would quietly disable the guard.

# cannot converge is also the one route into these environments that does not
# ask about the allowlist.
#
# Empty is not "no opinion". install.sh renders `google_chat_allowed_users =
# []`, the chart's `with` omits the key, and the operator turns an absent list

# of an environment whose allowlist variable was never set admits the whole
# domain, and nothing in the run says so.

# rebuilt every run and no real user reaches them. An unconditional guard here
# would fail the RC pipeline on its next run rather than protect anything.
#
# Truthiness and emptiness are both inlined for the reason teardown_common.sh
# gives -- these scripts do not source installer_common.sh -- and both match it
