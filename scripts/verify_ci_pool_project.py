"""Pre-flight verification for onboarding a GCP project into the CI evaluation pool.

Validates that a project has completed every prerequisite in
docs/ci-pool-projects.md before it is registered in
the Boskos resource pool in gke-internal/test-infra.

Registering a project that has not finished onboarding does not fail only that
project: Boskos hands the half-built lease to some pull request, and that pull
request's smoke test dies. Run this before the Boskos entry lands.

Usage:

it is a stateless relay whose clients retry, and a budget would only slow node drains. The
namespace carries no NetworkPolicy by design either: nothing in it accepts traffic. `token-reader`
in `seeded-token` runs on the default ServiceAccount of its namespace with the token mounted by
design: it reads the API server with that identity. Its neighbour `token-sidecar` is not declared.
`seeded-c` publishes no GKE upgrade notifications by design: this fleet learns about upgrades from
the weekly audit. `burst-ingest` in `seeded-headroom` requests far more memory than it uses by
design: it is sized for an ingest burst the measured week does not show. The obtainability,
compliance, upgrade readiness and waste audits list the five postures under Declared intent rather
than as findings."""
