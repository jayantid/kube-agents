# Modular CLI tool for Day-2 upgrades of the Platform Agent harness and operator.

# The release-pinned script carries its own version, so no image tag is passed.
# It upgrades the install whose checkout the installer left in $HOME/kube-agents,
# reading the install.env in it; KUBE_AGENTS_INSTALL_ENV points at a
# configuration held somewhere else. The upgrade refuses to re-render cluster
# configuration without one.

                           it, so an upgrade to a published release passes no tag.
  --keep-image-tag         Upgrade everything except the images, leaving them on
                           the tag the install already serves. Use instead of
                           --image-tag, not alongside it; a script carrying a
                           baked release version already has one, and refuses it,
                           unless it runs from a release-line checkout past that
                           release, which carries no version of its own to keep.
  --drop-undeclared-values With --upgrade-mode=operator or harness, drop the
                           release's recorded values the target chart's schema
                           does not declare, instead of refusing the upgrade
                           over them. For a rollback to an older release.

# What release a non-Git source tree says it is, or "" when it says nothing.
#
# Two statements are consulted, because the bundle marker is not the only shape
# a stale tree arrives in. A bundle this repository packaged carries the marker.
# A copy of one with the marker removed, or a tree from a release predating the
# marker, still carries the version package_release_bundle.sh stamps into every
# root script, so the tree's own root scripts answer where the marker cannot.
#
# The order among those scripts matters, and upgrade.sh is deliberately last.
# The way an operator runs a newer upgrader against an older unpacked tree is
# `curl -o upgrade.sh …/<new>/upgrade.sh` inside it — which overwrites the one
# file being consulted, so it would report the new version and the tree would
# pass as matching while carrying the old release's Terraform, charts and CRDs.
# The packager stamps install.sh and uninstall.sh with the same version, and
# neither is in the way of that download, so they answer for the tree rather
# than for the script that happens to be running.
#
# What this still cannot see: a tree that was never stamped at all -- GitHub's
# auto-generated "Source code" archive of a tag is the plain repository content,
# where BAKED_RELEASE_VERSION is empty. Such a directory is indistinguishable
# from any other unversioned directory, and the arm below accepts it on the
# running script's baked version, which is what tests/test_upgrade_script.py's
# test_verify_local_source_ref_accepts_baked_release_in_non_git_dir pins.

  # that stops on one of those has applied none of the new release, so the
  # checkout this run detached has to go back. Each arm therefore flips the gate

  # UpgradeRunContractTest.test_the_apply_gate_sits_after_every_refusal_in_its_arm
  # pins that placement, which is otherwise unreachable from the test suite.
