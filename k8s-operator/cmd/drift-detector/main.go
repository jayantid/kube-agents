// Command drift-detector reads GKE audit records from the Pub/Sub subscription
// the terraform/modules/drift-pubsub module provisions, and turns out-of-band
// cluster changes into gitops-drift injects on the AutoOps pipeline.
//
// Kubernetes audit is not served by the Kubernetes API on GKE: the control
// plane is managed, so the audit stream surfaces only in Cloud Logging. A Log
// Router sink exports it to a topic, and this binary pulls the subscription.
//
// This is CUJ 3, built in four stages, all of which ship here. T1 is the
// ingestion path (pull and parse), T2 is principal classification (assign a
// tier, drop the calls that changed nothing), and T3 joins managedFields off
// the live object -- on the cluster this process holds credentials for, and on
// every cluster in the project that has a Cluster Agent profile under
// --profiles-dir. A record naming a cluster in neither is still forwarded, and
// counted unreachable. With --daemon-url set, what survives is posted to the
// core-agent daemon as a gitops-drift inject, which is where the pipeline the
// design describes takes over: session, agent, chat, human approval, GitOps PR
// -- except an unreachable record from a cluster no readable Cluster Agent
// profile names, which is outside the install's scope and is logged and held
// rather than injected (DriftEvent.OutOfScope).
//
// The inject is off unless --daemon-url is set, and off is the default. The
// agent images carry this binary and the credential proxy's entrypoint starts
// it, but only where the PlatformAgent sets spec.harness.driftDetector.enabled;
// absent that, it ships without running. The drift-pubsub Terraform module is a
// precondition for the detector to work rather than a second start gate: nothing
// fails closed on a missing subscription, so a detector enabled without one comes
// up and retries a pull that cannot succeed for the life of the pod. It never
// exits, so the entrypoint's short-exit ALERT cannot fire and the pod stays
// Ready. DriftDetectorSpec.Enabled in api/v1alpha1/common_types.go owns that
// fact and states it in full. See docs/designs/drift-detection.md for the design
// and deploy/shared/start-services.sh for the flags it is started with.
