//     it describes has scheduled or gone, and a pod still pending will be
//     sighted again within minutes with a fresh timestamp. Unknown timestamps
//     fail open, as unknown counts do.
//   - A NotTriggerScaleUp mark passes the event at any count, provided the
//     event was sighted later than the verdict. The autoscaler has ruled it
//     cannot help, so waiting for more repeats only delays the incident. A
//     sighting that does not postdate the verdict is the scheduler's last
//     attempt before the autoscaler ruled: live it was judged when it
//     arrived and is bumped again only on the next retry, after the verdict,
//     but an informer replay after a restart brings it back as it was, and
//     for a pod that was placed or deleted before that retry it is the only
//     object there is. It falls through to the count backstop, as it was
//     judged live, rather than opening a card for a pod that is Running or
//     gone. Later, not at-or-later: the core/v1 recorder stamps to the
//     second, the decline follows the attempt that drew it, and on a fast
//     autoscaler both land in the same second (seen live, both at
//     01:53:25Z, and the replay opened a card for a pod deleted two seconds
//     later), so a sighting in the verdict's own second is read as the
//     attempt that drew it. A retry in that same second waits for the next.
//     Both stamps are read to the second before they are compared: an
//     events.k8s.io/v1 sighting (eventTime, series.lastObservedTime) carries
//     microseconds while the autoscaler's core/v1 stamp is whole seconds, so
//     compared as they are a sighting at 25.400 would read as later than a
//     decline stamped 25 and the replay would pass it on GKE Standard, where
//     upstream kube-scheduler records through the new API.
//   - A TriggeredScaleUp mark holds the event at any count while the event's
//     last sighting is within scaleUpHold of the mark. A node is on its way;
//     the scheduler retries the pod on every cluster change while it joins,
//     and the count reaches any threshold before the node is Ready. The mark
//     is aged against the sighting and not against the clock because the two
//     differ after a restart: the scheduler stops re-emitting the event when
//     the pod schedules, so a replayed event's sighting is fixed at the end
//     of its scale-up while the clock keeps moving. Aged against the clock,
//     the mark would expire fifteen minutes after the scale-up triggered
//     while the sighting stayed under the staleness check for as long again
//     as the scale-up took, and a restart in that window would open a card
//     for a pod that had been Running for up to fifteen minutes. For a live
//     event the sighting is the present, so the two readings are the same;
//     a pod still pending past the hold is sighted again with a fresh
//     timestamp and falls through to the count as before.
//   - Otherwise the count backstop applies, with the same fail-open on zero
//     as the other debounces. The count is one event object's: both recorders
//     start a new object at count 1 when the scheduler's message changes, so
//     a pod whose message churns reaches the threshold later than one whose
//     message holds still. Summing a pod's objects was tried and withdrawn:
//     on the live install it reached five across two objects eight seconds
//     after the pod was created, one second before cluster-autoscaler's
//     TriggeredScaleUp, and opened a card for a pod that scheduled 37 seconds
//     later, while no single object had passed four. The per-object count
//     damps that burst; the price is a slower card on a cluster without an
//     autoscaler while the message keeps changing.
//
// Not a settle timer: a live event is never delayed by wall-clock time, only
// by what the autoscaler said or by how often the scheduler has repeated it.
// Each decision logs one line, since the deployed install exposes no metrics.
