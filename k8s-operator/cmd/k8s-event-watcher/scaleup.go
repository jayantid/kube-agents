// verdict and the FailedScheduling it qualifies are two different events, and
// the dedup key is (UID, Reason), so nothing downstream would correlate them.
//
// The namespace is in the key because the UID alone is the author's word. The
// API server binds an event's namespace to its involved object's, so a mark
// can only be written where its author may create events, but it does not
// check that involvedObject.uid names a real object there; keyed on the UID
// alone, a mark written in one namespace against the UID of a pod in another
// (kube-system's, say, read off kube_pod_info or an owner reference) would be
// found by that pod's FailedScheduling and hold or release its card from a
// namespace with no access to it. With the namespace in the key the mark
// reaches only a pod in the namespace it was written in, which is the reach
// the reporter check (scaleUpReporter) already assumes.
//
// The namespace is also what a full memo evicts by: the cap is one per
// cluster, and evicting the oldest mark in the cluster regardless of namespace
// would let the same principal, writing marks under the autoscaler's reporter
// against invented UIDs in its own namespace, push every other namespace's
// marks out of the memo — not a hold or a release but a forget, which sends a
// kube-system pod mid-scale-up to the count backstop. The memo instead evicts
// from the namespace holding the most marks, so a namespace loses a mark only
// to one holding at least as many, and the flooding namespace loses its own.
//
// Latest is by event time, not arrival order, so a replayed older mark cannot
// overwrite a newer one. A later TriggeredScaleUp supersedes a NotTriggerScaleUp
// (the autoscaler changed its mind, a node group was resized) and the reverse
// supersedes too (the scale-up it started did not help). The map, the expiry
// and the eviction are boundedEntries (memo.go), shared with pullClassMemo;
// an entry here is dated by the event, so both age from the mark's At.
