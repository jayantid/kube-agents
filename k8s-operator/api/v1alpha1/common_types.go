//
// FIVE fields, because spec.deployment has five user-authored volume and mount
// surfaces and a reservation that covers four of them is not a reservation:
// sidecars[].volumeMounts, initContainers[].volumeMounts, sidecarVolumes,
// extraVolumes and extraVolumeMounts. The last one was the miss. It names no
// container, so it does not read like a mount surface at all — but
// buildBaseContainers appends it verbatim to the platform-agent container AND
// to platform-agent-dashboard, which put the projected bus token into a second
// container with the CR never mentioning one. spec.deployment.storages is NOT
// in the list and does not need to be: it renders a PersistentVolumeClaim
// volume under the name plus a "-vol" suffix, so it cannot collide with a
// reserved name or carry a token projection.
//
// This map is the NAME half. It shipped alone first, and a check on names
// alone left the volume SOURCE unexamined: a differently-named projected
// volume whose serviceAccountToken.audience is `a2a-bus`, mounted into a
// sidecar, minted the same credential and was admitted (established by
// execution: a sidecarVolumes entry named innocuous-cache projecting that
// audience rendered intact and the sidecar authenticated as `agent`), and a
// volume mounting the credentials Secret needed no token at all. The SOURCE
// half is BusCredentialRoutes below, keyed on the audience and on the Secrets
// the operator renders with bus credentials in them.
//
// A hostPath entry on those same two lists is refused by a source check too,
// and the render drops it and every mount naming it whether or not the
// webhook ran (gke-labs#1675). That one is not part of this pair: it guards
// the node filesystem, not the bus credential.
//
// Which fixes the terms this should be read on. KSA tokens are pod-scoped and
// the callout cannot see which container presented one, so neither a name nor
// an audience reservation is a boundary against a hostile sidecar; it is a
// guard against a misconfiguration. Worth having on those terms for the reason
// agentForbiddenVolumeNames gives for the same class in
// credential_proxy_manifests.go: the CR is authored by the platform operator
// and not by the agent — buildPlatformLocalRole grants the agent
// get/list/watch on its own CR and nothing more, and no tenant-facing or
// aggregated role on platformagents ships — so this is a configuration hazard
// rather than an escape, guarded because nothing else would notice. That rests
// on who may write the CR, which makes it re-decidable rather than settled: a
// delegable role, or the CR moving into a repo the agent can open pull
// requests against, changes the answer. BusCredentialRoutes below is the
// source half of this reservation: the audience route, and the creds-Secret
// route that is cheaper than it.
//
// One member so far. `a2a-bus-token` is the projected ServiceAccount token the
// platform-agent container presents to the bus under `mode: next`, and it is
// that container's alone — the auth callout resolves the POD's ServiceAccount,
// so any other container mounting this token is a second workload wearing the
// agent's bus identity. One that also holds bridge-password would hold the
// union of the two grant sets, which is the retired `worker` credential rebuilt
// out of a volumeMount. See a2aStripBusTokenMounts and, for the fifth field,

// while the render strips it (see a2aStripBusCredentialSources in the
// controller).
//
// Two routes. A projected serviceAccountToken for A2ABusTokenAudience is the
// token the platform-agent container presents, minted for the pod's
// ServiceAccount, so the name on the volume changes nothing about what the
// callout sees. The Secrets in A2ACredentialSecretNames need no token minting
// at all and are the cheaper route; a check on the audience alone would narrow
// the expensive route and advertise the cheap one. There are three of them
// because the same credentials sit in three places: the creds Secret holds
// the static passwords (`bridge-password` among them), the nats-config Secret
// holds nats.conf with every one of those passwords inline, and the
// callout-keys Secret holds the issuer seed that signs every identity the bus
// accepts, which is worth more than any password in the other two.
//
// Volume shapes only. A `secret` volume and a projected `secret` source are
// the two volume shapes that put a Secret's data in the container; the other
// volume sources that name a Secret (csi.nodePublishSecretRef, the storage
// drivers' secretRef fields) hand it to a node plugin rather than to the
// container. What this does NOT cover is env: `env[].valueFrom.secretKeyRef`
// and `envFrom[].secretRef` on a sidecar deliver the same bytes and are not
// checked here. That is deliberate rather than an oversight. The bridge
// sidecar's documented configuration (a2a/docs/hermes-bridge.md) is a
// secretKeyRef to `bridge-password` on the creds Secret, so a refusal on env
// would refuse the supported bridge; which keys a sidecar may read by env is
// a policy this reservation does not set. The issue this closes scoped the
// Secret half to volumes (its precedent, agentForbiddenVolumeNames, is
// volume-keyed too); the env half is a decision still owed.
//
// What this is, so the guard is not read as more than it is: KSA tokens are
// pod-scoped and the callout cannot tell which container presented one, so
// neither this nor the name reservation is a boundary against a hostile
// sidecar. It is a guard against a misconfiguration by the CR's author, who is
// the platform operator (ReservedVolumeNames says why that is the actor), and
// it is worth having on those terms because nothing else would notice.

	// Unset means 2, the operator's default — not Hermes' own behaviour, which does not
	// cap concurrency at all. The default exists because a worker is a full agent process
	// holding a few hundred MiB for the length of the task: unbounded dispatch lets a
	// burst of queued cards spawn workers until the cgroup OOM killer takes them, and
	// that kills a child process rather than the container, so it produces no Kubernetes
	// event and no restart while the dispatcher strands the card instead of retrying it.

	// The cap is bought at a real price, so raise it deliberately rather than leaving it
	// alone by default. A slot is held for a worker's entire run, so capping serialises
	// minutes of model work: measured against real fan-outs on a live cluster, capping at
	// 2 roughly doubled the time for a batch to finish. One exception: a worker that is
	// only waiting on cards it fanned out does not hold a slot, or it would block the very
	// children it is waiting for. Do NOT reach for a lower value as a latency fix — an

	// map bounds WHO can spawn and this bounds HOW MANY.
	//
	// Unset means 10, the operator's default - a "busy day" sizing: at the
	// session-pod shape (250m CPU / 512Mi requests) ten concurrent sessions
	// hold 2.5 CPU / 5Gi, which a small dev cluster absorbs without
	// preemption.
	//
	// The number lands in three places that deliberately differ. The gateway's
	// A2A_MAX_SESSIONS env carries it as a usability control: at the cap a new
	// delegation is refused with a chat reply naming the numbers, never queued,
	// never dropped. The namespace ResourceQuota is rendered a fixed headroom
	// ABOVE it as the enforcement control: a compromised or buggy gateway
	// ignores its own cap and cannot ignore the quota, and keeping the quota
	// above the cap is what makes users hit the honest refusal rather than an
	// opaque admission failure. The quota is namespace-wide - the only shape a
	// hostile pod-creator cannot dodge - so its headroom above the cap also
	// bounds everything else in the namespace: an install whose namespace
	// carries many non-session pods can see unrelated pod creation refused at
	// admission before sessions reach this cap, and the headroom is an
	// operator constant, not a CR field. The third is the bus: the TASKS
	// stream's max_consumers is provisioned from this number, because each
	// session pod creates three named consumers there and a stream that
	// cannot hold the configured concurrency refuses a legitimate session's
	// consumer create at load. That one is capacity, not a control - it is
	// sized to fit this cap rather than to enforce it - and because
	// provisioning never edits an existing stream, an install whose TASKS
	// stream is too small for the configured cap makes the provision Job
	// fail rather than letting the shortfall surface later as a legitimate
	// session's consumer create being refused and reported as a task
	// failure. What that refusal names is the ways out - two, or three when
	// the bridge runs more workers than its default of 2, where fewer is
	// offered too (the operator's A2A_BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY for the bridge it
	// renders, BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY for a bridge sidecar the CR declares) -
	// and none is a stream edit, because max_consumers is the one limit
	// nats-server will not change on a stream that already exists: lower
	// this number (or that worker count) until it fits the stream, or
	// delete TASKS and let provisioning recreate it at the width this
	// number asks for, paying the task history the stream was holding.
	// They do not finish the same way. Lowering this number, or the worker
	// count, re-renders the provision Job, so it re-runs by itself.
	// Recreating the stream also needs the provision Job re-run,
	// and then the A2A gateway restarted - deleting a stream deletes the
	// durable consumers on it, the gateway's event relay and any Hermes
	// bridge sidecar do not re-create theirs, and a gateway in that state
	// still accepts delegations and spawns session pods while relaying no
	// events. The refusal names the order. An operator upgrade reaches that
	// refusal as readily as an edit here does: a stream created before the
	// derivation existed holds whatever it was created with, whatever this
	// field says.
	//
	// Raising it buys concurrent delegations at the per-pod price plus model
	// concurrency against the shared LiteLLM endpoint; the quota lifts with it.

	// them permits — and the API has no deny rule, so an added policy is a
	// monotone operation. It cannot subtract. The agent Pod is already selected
	// for egress by <name>-gateway-netpol, which the operator renders on every
	// reconcile whether this field is set or not — unless
	// spec.networkPolicy.enabled is false, which withholds the gateway policy.
	// That makes this the Pod's only policy: the one shape where this field
	// enforces for real on an enforcing CNI, denying everything off its list.
	// Everywhere else, turning this on leaves the
	// Pod's permitted egress a strict superset of what it was. In the default
	// shape the only destination it adds is the credential broker on TCP 8765
	// — plus, when the agent is not exporting telemetry, the managed collector
	// namespace on 4317/4318, because the gateway policy omits its own OTel
	// rule in that case and this one keeps gke-managed-otel, which the Hermes
	// tracing plugin still addresses there. With an endpoint, both policies
	// name the namespace read off it. Anything egressAllowlist names is added
	// on top of that.
	//
	// What the gateway policy already permits, and therefore what this cannot
	// take away:
	//
	//   - 169.254.169.254/32 on TCP 80, plus the discovered metadata-daemon port (988 by default) to both link-local
	//     metadata addresses — the pre- and post-DNAT forms of a metadata
	//     request (the 988 rule is suppressed when the resolved metadata
	//     daemon IP is empty). So the metadata path stays open. The same
	//     address is also permitted on port 53, where it is the Cloud DNS for
	//     GKE resolver rather than a credential path.
	//   - TCP 443 to 0.0.0.0/0 minus the private ranges, unless the
	//     FQDNNetworkPolicy annotation is set. So every HTTPS destination on
	//     the public internet stays open, and with it the exfiltration half of
	//     what this control is meant to be.
	//
	// The overlap is deliberate rather than an oversight. Workload Identity
	// needs the metadata path, and <name>-gateway-netpol still permits it to
	// the agent Pod. Narrowing that allowance to the broker Pod, which is the
	// only one that mints a cloud token, is the work that turns this field into
	// a control.
	//
	// So what is this for today? Two things, and they are worth having, but
	// neither is enforcement. It renders an auditable statement of the
	// destinations the agent is supposed to need, in an object an operator can
	// diff and a reviewer can read. And it establishes the field, the refusal
	// rules and the reconcile behaviour, so that narrowing the gateway policy
	// later is a change to one policy rather than a new feature.
	//
	// Three conditions the operator cannot check for you.
	//
	//   - The policy does nothing at all on a cluster whose CNI does not
	//     enforce NetworkPolicy (GKE Standard without network policy enabled);
	//     Autopilot and GKE Dataplane V2 always enforce. An unenforced policy
	//     is stored and returned by kubectl exactly like an enforced one, so
	//     there is nothing for the operator to read.
	//   - Any other policy in the namespace that selects this Pod and permits
	//     wider egress re-opens what this one closes, as the two above do.
	//   - NodeLocal DNSCache, if the cluster runs it, may lose DNS entirely.
	//     It runs hostNetwork, so on Cilium and Dataplane V2 its traffic
	//     carries a host or remote-node identity, which neither the
	//     k8s-app: node-local-dns Pod selector nor the 169.254.20.10/32 CIDR
	//     peer in the rendered DNS rule is guaranteed to match. Both work on
	//     an iptables dataplane, which is why both are rendered. This is the
	//     only one of the three that can take the agent down rather than
	//     quietly weaken it — every allowlisted destination is reached by
	//     name, so no DNS means no egress at all. Check
	//     `kubectl -n kube-system get ds node-local-dns` and confirm
	//     resolution from the agent container after enabling.
	//
	// WHAT IT WILL COST, once the gateway policy is narrowed and this field
	// starts blocking things. None of the following happens today, for the
	// reason above: every destination on this list is one <name>-gateway-netpol
	// still permits to the same Pod. Read it as the bill that falls due, not as
	// the current behaviour — and do not schedule a capability review for a
	// change that will not alter anything yet.
	//
	// The allowlist covers DNS, the credential broker, LiteLLM, the namespace
	// of the OpenTelemetry collector the agent resolved, the Hindsight memory
	// API, and whatever egressAllowlist adds. Everything else the agent
	// container reaches on its own would go away:
	//
	//   - DuckDuckGo web search, which the shared default config turns on for
	//     every profile, and the "browser" toolset, which only the Chat Agent
	//     disables;
	//   - the gke and developer_knowledge MCP servers, which proxy
	//     container.googleapis.com and developerknowledge.googleapis.com;
	//   - github.com reached directly from the sandbox, though not the gh and
	//     git wrappers, which go through the broker;
	//   - the metadata lookup in cluster_agent_reconcile.py, which finds that
	//     script's project id. It fails soft after a five-second timeout and
	//     falls back to a broker gcloud call. RECONCILE_PROJECT, the old override, is
	//     pinned empty in the managed .env (a project other than the pod's belongs in
	//     spec.scope.projects, the management project still has to resolve).
	//
	// Those would not be accidental casualties. A headless browser with
	// unrestricted egress is the exfiltration path, so the capabilities this
	// would remove are the same ones that make the control worth having. Restore
	// individual destinations with egressAllowlist.extraRules — noting that
	// NetworkPolicy matches addresses, never DNS names, so restoring a hosted
	// service means naming its address ranges.
	//
	// Credentialed gcloud and kubectl, and the version-control verbs, are
	// unaffected: all of them call the broker, and the broker is on the
	// allowlist.
	//
	// TURNING THIS OFF DOES NOT DELETE THE POLICY. An egress policy is a
	// guardrail, and the operator will not remove a guardrail it may not have
	// created, so setting this back to "None" leaves
	// <name>-sandbox-metadata-deny in place, still denying what it denied. To
