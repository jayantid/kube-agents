# Kubernetes Agentic Harness Operator

This directory contains the Kubernetes Operator for the `kube-agents` harness. The operator defines and manages the lifecycle of agent custom resources:

- **PlatformAgent**: Manages platform-level configuration and capabilities.

The operator is built using the Kubebuilder framework and is written in Go.

---

## Prerequisites

Before building or deploying the operator, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.27+)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or Podman (for building container images)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) (configured to access your Kubernetes/GKE cluster)
- Access to a running Kubernetes/GKE cluster
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) (for GKE cluster access)

---

## Bootstrapping GCP & GKE Infrastructure

The install engine is Terraform + Helm: `terraform/examples/full-install` owns every GCP
resource and `charts/kube-agents` every Kubernetes resource. To stand up a real GKE/GCP
environment, use the repository-root installer, or drive the composition directly:

```bash
# The zero-friction path: interview, terraform.tfvars generation, apply.
../install.sh

# Or hand-driven, with your own tfvars:
cd ../terraform/examples/full-install
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # then edit it
./lifecycle.sh apply
```

Teardown is `../uninstall.sh`, or `./lifecycle.sh destroy` from the composition directory. See
[INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) for the full walkthrough and
[scripts/installer/README.md](../scripts/installer/README.md) for the installer's shared
helpers and the `install.env` configuration model. Those helpers used to live in this
directory; they moved out because they serve the installer, not the operator.

For fast local iteration when updating agent skills, prompts, or code without waiting for CI/CD
pipelines, use the dedicated rebuild script or `make` target:

```bash
# Run interactively via make
make dev-rebuild-agent

# Or specify arguments directly
make dev-rebuild-agent ARGS="platform"
```

- **[scripts/dev/dev_rebuild_agent.sh](../scripts/dev/dev_rebuild_agent.sh)**:
  - Prompts for or accepts an agent target (`platform`).
  - Ensures the GCP Artifact Registry repository exists. Clean it up later with
    [`scripts/dev/teardown_dev_01_gcp_artifact_registry.sh`](../scripts/dev/teardown_dev_01_gcp_artifact_registry.sh).
  - Builds and pushes the updated container image via Google Cloud Build (or locally with `--local`).
  - Automatically updates any running Custom Resources and rolling-restarts Kubernetes Deployments in GKE with the new image.

### Building on a private worker pool

Cloud Build runs on the project's default pool (2 vCPU) unless you point it elsewhere. To use a
[private pool](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/private-pools-overview) with more
CPU, export its full resource name:

```bash
export CLOUD_BUILD_WORKER_POOL=projects/PROJECT/locations/REGION/workerPools/POOL
```

`dev_rebuild_agent.sh` and `hack/ci-deploy.sh` both read this variable and pass `--worker-pool`
(along with the pool's region parsed from the name) to `gcloud builds submit`. Leave it unset to use
the default pool. The worker pool must allow public egress, or image builds fail when pulling base
images and downloading dependencies.

The two scripts handle the unset case differently. `dev_rebuild_agent.sh` takes the default pool's
default machine (2 vCPUs), while `hack/ci-deploy.sh` requests `e2-highcpu-8` because it compiles all
four container images (platform, credential-proxy, sandbox and operator) in a single Cloud Build
submission ([`deploy/docker/cloudbuild-ci.yaml`](../deploy/docker/cloudbuild-ci.yaml)), with the
sandbox and operator builds running in parallel alongside the platform-agent and credential-proxy
builds. Because private worker pools define their own fixed machine types and reject
`--machine-type`, `hack/ci-deploy.sh` only passes `--machine-type` when `CLOUD_BUILD_WORKER_POOL`
is unset.

---

## Local Development (Fast Iteration)

The operator is a standard Kubebuilder project; `make help` lists every target. `make manifests`
writes to `config/crd/bases/`, `config/rbac/` and `config/webhook/`, and `make test` downloads the
envtest binaries to `bin/` on first run.

`make build`, `make run` and `make test` all run `manifests`, `generate`, `fmt` and `vet` first, so
generated code and manifests stay in sync automatically. `make install`, `make uninstall` and
`make deploy` deliberately do not: they apply the manifests exactly as committed, so a deploy ships
what is in git rather than whatever the local tree happens to regenerate, and leaves no modified
files behind. Run `make manifests` yourself after changing the API types — CI fails if the committed
output is stale.

For local development and testing, you can run the operator controller as a local Go process on your machine, while pointing it to a remote GKE or local Kubernetes cluster. This bypasses the need to build and push container images on every code change.

### Step 1: Set Active Kubernetes Context

Ensure your `kubectl` is pointed to the correct cluster:

```bash
# Check the active context
kubectl config current-context

# If needed, authenticate and switch to your GKE cluster
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <CLUSTER_NAME> --zone <ZONE> --project <PROJECT_ID>
```

### Step 2: Install the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

Register the operator's Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) with the cluster:

```bash
make install
```

> [!NOTE]
> This applies the CRD manifests **as committed** in `config/crd/bases/`, via `kustomize`. It does not run `controller-gen`, so edits to the Go API types do not reach the cluster until you run `make manifests` and install again (see the note on build targets above).

### Step 3: Run the Operator Locally

Start the operator controller process. Because admission webhooks require TLS certificates (typically managed by cert-manager when running inside the cluster), you should run the operator locally with webhooks disabled by setting the `ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false` environment variable:

```bash
ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false make run
```

Off the cluster `POD_NAMESPACE` is unset, so the operator renders no NetworkPolicy rule admitting
itself to the agent pods' metrics ports and does not start the poller behind `status.usage`'s
counters; it says so in one start-up line, and the counters stay where they are until the operator
runs in the cluster.

Or directly run the main entry point:

```bash
ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false go run ./cmd/main.go
```

> [!TIP]
> This compiles and runs the entry point [main.go](cmd/main.go) with webhooks disabled. The process runs in the foreground, prints reconciliation logs, and watches for custom resource events in the cluster.

When webhooks are enabled, the server binds `10250` rather than Kubebuilder's usual `9443`: it is one of only two ports GKE's automatic control-plane-to-node firewall rule permits, so a private cluster reaches the webhook without a hand-added VPC rule. Where 10250 is not the reachable port, `--webhook-port`, the manager `containerPort`, and the Service `targetPort` have to be changed together — the flag alone moves the listener and leaves the Service dialing a dead port, which fail-closed admission turns into a wedged cluster. The rationale, the Kustomize patch that moves all three, the drift guard across them, and the recovery steps for an unreachable webhook are in [Admission webhooks](../docs/site/src/content/docs/operator/index.md#admission-webhooks).

### Step 4: Apply Sample Custom Resources

In another terminal window, apply the sample custom resources to test the controllers:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/platformagent.yaml
```

Verify that the resources are created and recognized:

```bash
kubectl get platformagents --all-namespaces
```

You should see reconciliation logs printed in the terminal where the operator process is running.

### Step 5: Clean Up Local Resources

To stop the operator, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it is running.
To uninstall the CRDs from the cluster:

```bash
make uninstall
```

---

## Building and Deploying to GKE

When you are ready to deploy the operator as a deployment inside the cluster, use the following steps.

### Step 1: Build and Push the Docker Image

Build the container image and push it to a container registry (e.g., Google Artifact Registry) accessible by your GKE cluster.

#### 1. Authenticate Docker with the Registry

Before pushing, ensure your local Docker client is authenticated with Google Cloud's container registries. Run the command matching your registry domain:

```bash
# For Google Artifact Registry (recommended, e.g. us-central1 region)
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev

# For Google Container Registry (legacy)
gcloud auth configure-docker gcr.io
```

#### 2. Build and Push

Set the image target URL and run the build/push targets:

```bash
# Replace with your actual registry. The tag must be immutable: `make deploy`
# refuses a floating tag such as `latest`, because it lets a pod reschedule
# upgrade the controller past the RBAC applied with it.
export IMG=<your-registry>/kube-agents-operator:$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# Build the image
make docker-build IMG=$IMG

# Push the image to the registry
make docker-push IMG=$IMG
```

### Step 2: Deploy the Operator Controller

Deploy the operator deployment, RBAC permissions, and CRDs into the cluster:

```bash
make deploy IMG=$IMG
```

The refused tags and the `ALLOW_MUTABLE_IMG=1` override are on the
[operator page](../docs/site/src/content/docs/operator/index.md#an-image-ahead-of-its-clusterrole).
`make undeploy` removes the deployment.

### Step 3: Verify the Deployment

Check the status of the operator deployment:

```bash
kubectl get deployments -n kubeagents-system
kubectl get pods -n kubeagents-system
```

## Deploying LiteLLM Integration

> [!NOTE]
> LiteLLM is deployed automatically by the kube-agents Helm chart (`litellm.enabled`, default true). The following instructions are for manual standalone kustomize deployment.

LiteLLM gateway can be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster using the `kustomize` targets in the Makefile.

### Prerequisites

To successfully deploy LiteLLM, you must have:

1. The `platform-agent-secrets` Secret created in your destination namespace (containing `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

### Step-by-Step Deployment

Run the `make deploy-litellm` target, passing the required environment variables:

```bash
# 1. Define model provider and default model name:
export MODEL_PROVIDER=gemini
export MODEL_DEFAULT_NAME=gemini-3.5-flash

# 2. Deploy LiteLLM:
make deploy-litellm
```

To uninstall/remove the LiteLLM integration:

```bash
make undeploy-litellm
```

## Deploying GitHub Integration

The GitHub Token Broker (Minty) can be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster using the `kustomize` targets in the Makefile.

> [!NOTE]
> **Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Infrastructure & Local Development:**
>
> - This manual `make deploy-github` path requires **Ahead-Of-Time (AOT)** provisioning: the GitHub App and Cloud KMS asymmetric signing key (with its imported private key) must be provisioned upfront (unlike `install.sh --github-pem-path`, which can import `.pem` automatically).
> - For **local operator development** (`make run`, Kind, Minikube), Minty is completely **optional** and not required for reconciling `PlatformAgent` resources or cluster observation. It is only dialed at runtime when GitOps skills (`submit-suggestion`, `fleet-audit`) open pull requests.
> - Setup guides: [Token minter](../docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/token-minter.md) and upstream [`abcxyz/github-token-minter`](https://github.com/abcxyz/github-token-minter).

### Prerequisites

Before deploying the GitHub integration, ensure you have:

1. Created the `github-app-credentials` Secret containing your GitHub App ID (`app-id`) in the destination namespace:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic github-app-credentials \
     --namespace kubeagents-system \
     --from-literal=app-id="<GITHUB_APP_ID>"
   ```
2. Completed the Workload Identity and GCP Cloud KMS AOT setup (see [config/integrations/github/README.md](config/integrations/github/README.md) for details).

### Step-by-Step Deployment

Run the `make deploy-github` target, passing the required environment variables. The KSA/GSA names below are the same defaults the installer uses (the GSA names from [`install.defaults.env`](../install.defaults.env), the KSA names from [`scripts/installer/common.sh`](../scripts/installer/common.sh)), but they still have to be exported here: `make deploy-github` renders the manifests with `envsubst` and does not source `common.sh`, so an unset variable would be substituted as an empty string.

`KMS_LOCATION` is the Cloud KMS location, which is separate from `REGION`, the GKE cluster location. Cloud KMS has no zonal locations, so the two differ for a zonal cluster: a cluster in `us-central1-c` needs `KMS_LOCATION=us-central1`. For a regional cluster they are the same value.

`GITHUB_ORG` must name a GitHub organization, not a user: the Minter resolves installations at `/orgs/{org}/installation`, which returns 404 for personal accounts. This manual path bypasses the installer's check for it — see [`config/integrations/github/README.md`](config/integrations/github/README.md).

```bash
# 1. Define the GCP and GitHub parameter variables:
export PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
export REGION=your-gcp-region
export CLUSTER_NAME=your-gke-cluster-name
export KMS_LOCATION=your-kms-region
export KMS_KEYRING=your-kms-keyring
export KMS_KEY=your-kms-key
export KMS_KEY_VERSION=your-kms-key-version
export GITHUB_ORG=your-github-org
export GITHUB_REPO=your-github-repo
export GITHUB_MINTER_KSA_NAME=kubeagents-github-minter
export GITHUB_MINTER_GSA_NAME=kubeagents-github-minter-gsa
export PLATFORM_AGENT_GSA_NAME=kubeagents-platform-gsa

# 2. Deploy GitHub:
make deploy-github
```

To uninstall/remove the GitHub integration:

```bash
make undeploy-github
```

`make deploy-inference-replay` / `make undeploy-inference-replay` do the same for the inference
replay proxy. These kustomize copies are the development path for the components the Helm chart
renders in a stock install.

## RBAC Migration & Deprecation Guidelines

When modifying or deprecating RBAC roles or rolebindings in the operator:

1. **Update active role construction:** update the builder functions (`buildPlatformLocalRole`,
   `buildMinimalPlatformRole`, etc.) to generate the new role definitions.
2. **Dynamic legacy role cleanup:** never leave old roles or rolebindings orphaned on existing
   clusters. `reconcileRBAC()` audits every `RoleBinding` in the namespace attached to the agent's
   ServiceAccount and deletes any non-canonical `kubeagents*` binding.
3. **Sync controller RBAC annotations:** make sure the `// +kubebuilder:rbac` markers on the
   reconciler include every permission the operator itself needs to grant or clean up, then run
   `make manifests` to regenerate `config/rbac/role.yaml`.

---

## Formatting and CI

`prettier.yml` enforces Markdown and YAML formatting (`**/*.{md,yaml,yml}`) in CI; the local
targets are under `make help`. The workflows that exercise this directory: `k8s-operator-test.yml` runs `make test`, `docker-publish-ghcr.yml` publishes the manager
image alongside the agent images, and `e2e-gchat-test.yml` is the end-to-end Google Chat test.

---

## Makefile Reference

```bash
make help
```

`make help` prints every documented target with its description, generated from the Makefile.
It replaces the table that previously lived here, which had to be updated by hand whenever a
target changed.
