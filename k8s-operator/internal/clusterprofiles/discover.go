// Discover scans a Hermes profiles directory (normally /opt/data/profiles) and
// returns one Cluster per Cluster Agent profile found.
//
// This runs once, at the caller's startup, so the result is a snapshot rather
// than something kept in step with the directory. A cluster onboarded later is
// not reached until the process restarts, and one torn down later leaves the
// caller holding a config for a control plane that is gone. Re-scanning on an
// interval and reconciling against the result is deliberate follow-up work, not
// done here.
//
// A subdirectory is treated as a cluster profile only if its config.yaml
// carries a complete cluster_identity block. That is how non-cluster profiles
// ("default", "platform") are skipped: testing for the data we need is more
// durable than hardcoding a list of names that the Python side may extend.
// ReadIdentities does name those two, and only to stay silent about them when
// they are broken: for the scope the question is not "which profiles address a
// cluster" but "which drops are worth a line", and a reserved profile is never
// a cluster's whatever state it is in.
//
// The identity is also the whole of what a config is built from, and that is a
// deliberate change of source. Discovery used to require a kubeconfig.yaml
// beside config.yaml and read the API server address out of it, which stopped
// working the moment the shell moved into its own pod: `gcloud container
// clusters get-credentials` now runs there, so the file it writes lands on the
// sandbox's volume and this process never sees it. Every profile created after
// that change would have been silently missed. Asking the GKE API for the
// address removes the dependency rather than reinstating it — and it has to be
// removed rather than reinstated, because anything read back out of the sandbox
// is writable by the model, and a caller attaches a cloud-platform token to
// whatever host it is told to talk to.
//
// A profile that looks like a cluster profile but fails to load is skipped, not
// fatal. Dropping one cluster is bad; the alternative is worse, because these
// errors would propagate out of the caller's startup before it has built
// anything, so a single unparseable config.yaml would stop it reaching any
// cluster at all — including the one whose own client would have been fine.
// Every skip goes to OnSkip, so "this cluster is not being reached" stays
// visible and alertable without being fatal.
//
// Failing to read the directory splits two ways, because a restart fixes one
// kind of failure and not the other.
//
// A directory that does not exist yet is an error return. It is written by
// another process that may simply not have run, so exiting is what makes the
// caller self-healing: whatever supervises it restarts it, and the next attempt
// succeeds once the directory appears. Degrading instead would be permanent —
// discovery runs once, so a process that starts without profiles keeps going
// without them until something else restarts it, which is a far worse outcome
// than a few seconds of restarts at boot.
//
// Any other read error — permissions, I/O — is not something a restart will
// fix, so those go to OnSkip and return no clusters rather than crashlooping
// forever.
//
// Finding none is not an error either. A freshly installed harness has no
// Cluster Agent profiles until the first cluster-agent-reconcile tick creates
// them, so an empty result is a normal startup state rather than a
// misconfiguration. The caller decides whether that leaves it with nothing to
// do.
