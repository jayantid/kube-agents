// The A2A stack the operator renders under `mode: next` and nothing else:
// the NATS/JetStream component, its stream/KV/topic provisioning, and the A2A
// gateway Deployment. Dark by construction — no call site outside the
// renderMode gate in Reconcile reaches this file.
//
// The deployment spec (docs/designs/spec-nats-deployment.md) is the law for
// streams, retention, and the account layout; subjects come from the payload
// spec (docs/designs/spec-a2a-payloads.md).
//
// PLAYGROUND POSTURE (stage 1): single-node R1 JetStream (production: 3-node
// R3), no audit exporter, no breaker, gateway sweep as the only janitor. Each
// has a decided design in the specs; none gates letting people play.
//
// Authentication came off that list. The auth callout is armed, and the
// identities that have a ServiceAccount and a client that presents it — the
// session pods above all — authenticate through it. The static users that
// remain are enumerated in a2aPostureComment below, which travels onto the
// cluster in the rendered config; keep the two in step.

# validates it against the cluster with a TokenReview, and answers with the
# permission set the operator mapped that identity to. Session pods go through
# it, and a session's grants are derived from the pod the API server attested
# rather than read from a map, so two sessions on one account cannot reach each
# other.
#
# The users that remain static below are of two kinds, and each says which it
# is where it is defined. Some have nothing to present: a browser, an operator
# at a port-forward, the callout itself, which cannot authenticate through
# itself. The rest have a ServiceAccount and could move tomorrow, but no client

	// it surfaces to the user as a task failure rather than as the capacity error
	// it is. The cap and the stream now come off the same number.
	//
	// The floor is why a default install sees no change. max_consumers was 64
	// before this derived it, and 64 is also what stops the `web` user - which
	// holds $JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.TASKS.> and no DELETE, because durability is
	// a request-body field no subject list can see - from growing the file store
	// with an unreapable durable per page load. Deriving downward would quietly
	// tighten that on every existing install for a reason that has nothing to do
	// with web, so the derivation only ever widens: max(64, budget).
	//
	// Widening has a cost and it is the same one, stated plainly: an install that
	// configures 10000 sessions also raises web's ceiling to ~30000. That is the

	// The replay term, and the mechanism it is sized from. lib.TasksGet
	// opens an ordered consumer on TASKS and its cleanup stops the local
	// subscription only; the consumer waits out the inactive threshold
	// TasksGet sets on it, lib.EphemeralConsumerInactiveThreshold (five
	// seconds; it was nats.go's five-minute ordered default until
	// gke-labs#1741). So a replay holds a slot for its own duration plus
	// five seconds, and the slots held at any instant are the replays BEGUN
	// in the last five seconds, not the replays in flight. What bounds that
	// is how many replays each caller can begin in five seconds. The callers
	// on main, with the structure that bounds each:
	//
	// The gateway, one replica. Every path but the sweep and the probe runs
	// under the conversation's session lock (a2a/gateway sessionLocks), so
	// one conversation has at most one of them running at a time:
	//
	//   - healActiveTask, once per inbound turn on a conversation with a
	//     running task, and answerStatusByReplay, once more when that turn is
	//     a status question: two replays back to back, per turn.
	//   - relayTerminal's fallback, once per terminal whose render state a
	//     restart lost, and closeDetachedBeforeDelete, once per retired pod
	//     holding a detached task: each at most once per task.
	//   - probeConversation, once per inject-door read carrying ?probe=1
	//     and once more after a wait that blocked, paced by the caller; it
	//     takes no lock.
	//   - sweepOnce, one per terminal orphan pod per pass, once a minute, in
	//     one goroutine, sequentially.
	//   - buildRehydrationPrimer, one per task in the conversation's history
	//     (capped at the gateway's taskHistoryCap), sequentially, per spawn.
	//
	// The Hermes bridge, one per install. Its durable delivers to one handler
	// at a time -- nats.go v1.53.1 jetstream/pull.go calls Consume's handler
	// from the subscription's own callback -- so these never overlap each
	// other:
	//
	//   - handleMessage, once per submission for a task it is not running,
	//     which is every new task; cancelOrphan, once per cancel for a task
	//     it is not running whose newest event is not already final (a
	//     final one is answered by direct get, no consumer).
	//   - sweepTask and synthesizeTerminal at start, before it consumes, one
	//     to four per in-flight key the prior incarnation left, sequentially.
	//
	// Two kinds of caller fall out of that list. A TRIGGER-PACED caller
	// replays once per external event -- a turn, a terminal, a submission,
	// a cancel, a pod delete, a read -- and its five-second count is the
	// event rate. A LOOP-PACED caller replays back to back with nothing in
	// between, and its five-second count is min(loop length, 5s / replay
	// latency): the rehydration primer, the two start-and-minute sweeps, and
	// the bridge's handler under a burst of submissions. Nothing the operator
	// sets bounds a loop-paced caller; at the 0.1s a replay takes against an
	// embedded server that is ~50 slots per loop, fewer on a slower bus. This
	// term does not size for them, and the cost of that is stated rather
	// than hidden: a replay refused at the cap fails soft on every path but
	// two -- the primer skips the task, the sweeps retry next pass or fail
	// the bridge's start (which restarts it) -- and the two that do not are
	// both in the bridge's handler, which acks when it returns:
	// handleMessage logs "events lookup failed after retries; dropping
	// submission", which loses the task, and cancelOrphan logs "cancel
	// events lookup failed after retries", which drops the cancel and leaves
	// the orphan non-terminal for the retention window. The cancel's retries
	// (six seconds, past the inactive threshold) make a brief refusal a late
	// cancel rather than a lost one; a new submission's lookup opens no
	// consumer and gets one quick retry; a burst wide enough to hold the cap
	// past them is that handler's hazard, and pacing it is a bridge change,
	// not a number here.
	//
	// What this term holds is the trigger-paced callers, each counted at
	// what can be in flight at once from the structure above, times
	// a2aTasksReplayTailFactor for the tail: the next replay from the same
	// source lands while the last one's five seconds are still running, so

	// replays before and after its wait -- one asker, two replays, either
	// way. The operator leaves the gateway's A2A_DEFAULT_ADDRESSEE at its
	// default, "platform", so a plain conversation's task is a bridge run
	// and a session pod is spawned only for a Delegate or a session-routed
	// record; the conversations being asked about while their task runs are
	// therefore the bridge's Concurrency runs. A conversation with a queued
	// bridge task, or with a session pod, can be asked about too; that is a
	// person or a harness at one conversation, once per ask, and the tail
	// factor is the allowance for it. It is not a per-session term today,
	// because maxSessions counts pods and a conversation's task is not one;
	// put in the multiplier it would size the reserve by the wrong number.
	// The day A2A_DEFAULT_ADDRESSEE flips to the session route (the
	// RouteSession sentinel in a2a/gateway; gke-labs#2033 is the open design
	// change that plans it), every conversation's task IS a pod, the asks row
	// becomes per-session, and it moves into the multiplier beside
	// a2aSessionConsumersPerSession.
	//
	// Two more things the three bridge rows rest on, both settable on the
	// CR. BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY is read. The sidecar is declared in
	// spec.deployment.sidecars, so its env is the CR's, and an install that
	// raises it (docs/designs/eval-next-transport.md commits the eval install
	// to at least its task parallelism) has that many running conversations
	// to be asked about, and that many workers looking ahead: the asks row
	// is a2aTasksReplayAsk per worker, the look-ahead row
	// a2aTasksReplayLookAhead per worker, and
	// a2aBridgeConcurrency reads the worker count off the CR the way the
	// bridge reads it off its environment. The rule, and what it cannot see:
	//
	//   - A sidecar is a bridge declaring its workers when its env sets
	//     BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY. Nothing else identifies the bridge container:
	//     the operator copies sidecars verbatim and names none of them
	//     (a2a/docs/hermes-bridge.md), and the env key is the bridge's own
	//     contract (a2a/cmd/hermes-bridge/main.go), so it is the one thing a
	//     bridge that changed its count must have written. A container that
	//     is not a bridge and sets it is over-counted, which widens.
	//   - The value is read the way envInt and Config.defaults read it once
	//     the kubelet has handed it over: a $(NAME) reference in the literal
	//     is expanded against the entries declared before it in the same
	//     container, in declaration order, as the kubelet expands it before
	//     the process starts (a2aBridgeConcurrencyValue), and then an
	//     integer above zero is the count, up to a2aBridgeConcurrencyMax,
	//     past which it is the cap and the refusal says so; an empty,
	//     non-integer or non-positive value is a2aBridgeDefaultConcurrency,
	//     because that is what the bridge runs with, and so is a literal too
	//     wide for an int, which envInt cannot parse either. A valueFrom
	//     cannot be read at render
	//     time -- the Secret or ConfigMap it names is read in the pod, not
	//     here -- and counts as the default too, as does a reference to
	//     one, stated in a NOTE the provision script prints on every run,
	//     refused or not, and in the refusal's status message, so an
	//     operator who set it that way knows the budget did not see it. No
	//     condition is raised for it: the number is a floor the bridge may
	//     exceed, not a refusal, and the provision script's log is where
	//     the reserve is already explained.
	//   - More than one sidecar setting it is summed, and the sum is capped
	//     at a2aBridgeConcurrencyMax the way one literal is: each bridge
	//     brings its own workers. A bridge that leaves it unset, or takes it
	//     through envFrom, which this render does not read, cannot be told
	//     from a fluent-bit container, so it is not counted -- the script's
	//     NOTE names a sidecar with envFrom and no entry in env, since the
	//     key may be arriving that way (a2aBridgeEnvFromUnread) -- and a CR where no
	//     sidecar sets it gets the default, which is exactly one bridge at
	//     the bridge's own default -- the shape this render assumed before
	//     it read anything. Within one container the last entry of that
	//     name wins, as it does in the pod.
	//
	// And one agent replica: replicas share the bridge's durable and each
	// brings its own workers, so a second replica doubles the dispatch row.
	// spec.deployment.replicas is not read here.
	//
	// Where the floor hides all this. The budget is maxSessions*3 + the
	// reserve, 32 at the default concurrency, and a stream is created at
	// max(64, budget), so a default install (maxSessions=10, budget 62)
	// still renders 64. The first maxSessions whose budget clears the floor
	// is 11 (65); it was 13 when the reserve was 28 and 17 when it was 16.
	// Above it the stream is 16 wider than it would have been, and so is the
	// web user's unreapable-durable ceiling, which is the trade the block
	// above already states.
	//
	// A declared bridge concurrency moves the reserve by
	// a2aTasksReplayTailFactor*(a2aTasksReplayAsk+a2aTasksReplayLookAhead),
	// 6 per worker -- the asks and the look-ahead, each with its tail: 44
	// at 4, 56 at 6, and either clears the floor at the default maxSessions
	// (74, 86). The gate at the end of the provision
	// script compares the budget to the live stream, so an install that
	// provisioned TASKS at 64 and then declared the sidecar is refused the
	// way a raised maxSessions is, with the same two ways out and a third
	// the refusal and the status message offer only then: declare the
	// sidecar with fewer workers, which re-renders the Job the way a
	// maxSessions edit does. A literal above a2aBridgeConcurrencyMax (below)
	// counts as the cap, and both surfaces say so. The mode-next step of

// and CREATE on an existing stream either returns that stream unchanged (when
// the config it carries is identical) or fails with JSStreamNameExistErr (when
// it differs). A RePublish edit is a differing config, so it takes the second

// a2aBridgeJetStreamGrants is the bridge's publish allow-list for the

// user's `$JS.API.>` wildcard was enumerated by gke-labs/kube-agents#1316, and
// A5 split the enumeration between the two workloads that were sharing it (the
// topic-stream half is a2aAgentJetStreamGrants below).
//
// The wildcard covered STREAM.PURGE, STREAM.UPDATE, STREAM.DELETE and
// STREAM.MSG.DELETE on every stream, DIRECTORY included. One PURGE empties the
// directory for every profile and nothing repopulates it; DELETE leaves only a
// re-run of the provision Job to bring the stream back.
//
// The list is what the bridge emits, read out of nats.go and then measured
// against a real server running this render
// (TestBridgeJetStreamGrantOnARealServer). Per stream:
//
//   - TASKS: STREAM.INFO (js.Stream in lib.TasksGet, lib.TaskInReplay,
//     lib.LastEnvelope and the sweep), CONSUMER.CREATE (the durable through
//     CreateOrUpdateConsumer, and the replay's ordered consumer; nats.go puts
//     the filter subject in the API subject, so the grant ends in `>`),
//     CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT (every pull), and DIRECT.GET (GetLastMsgForSubject:
//     the replay horizon, the sweep's CAS baseline, the worker's look-ahead
//     reading the in subject's newest message, and the orphan cancel reading
//     the newest event). Acks are $JS.ACK.TASKS.>, granted beside this list.
//   - KV_runtime-state, the in-flight registry: STREAM.INFO
//     (js.KeyValue binds a bucket by reading its stream), and CONSUMER.CREATE
//     with CONSUMER.DELETE (kv.Keys is a push ordered consumer that nats.go
//     creates and then deletes on Unsubscribe, and the sweep runs it at every
//     bridge start). Put and Delete are publishes on $KV.runtime-state.>,
//     granted beside this list. No DIRECT.GET: nothing on the path calls
//     kv.Get -- the bridge puts, deletes and lists, and the worker adapter
//     touches no bucket at all -- and when a caller appears the grant is
//     DIRECT.GET.KV_runtime-state.>, with the server test as the place its
//     absence shows.
//
// Reads go through DIRECT.GET and not STREAM.MSG.GET because every stream the
// provision script creates has allow_direct set: the script says
// --allow-direct on each `stream add` (natscli's default too, stated so the
// grant does not rest on one), a KV bucket always has it, and the live store
// shows it on all seven. nats.go picks the route from the stream's own config,
// so the fallback is never emitted and is not granted.
//
// What the wildcard granted that nothing on the bridge path uses, and this
// list now refuses: every verb on DIRECTORY (no STREAM.INFO, no consumer, no
// DIRECT.GET -- the gateway keeps subscribe on the cards, which is the read
// discovery needs), every verb on KV_session-state and KV_cap, PURGE / UPDATE /
// DELETE / MSG.DELETE / RESTORE / SNAPSHOT on every stream, STREAM.CREATE,
// enumeration (STREAM.NAMES, STREAM.LIST, CONSUMER.NAMES, CONSUMER.LIST),
// account INFO (jetstream.New never asks for it), and CONSUMER.INFO (nothing
// on the path binds to an existing consumer by name, and on nats.go v1.53.1
// no consumer re-verifies itself with it after a reconnect either --
// TestBridgeConsumersSurviveABusRestart holds that across a server restart).
//
// CONSUMER.DELETE on TASKS is withheld, and it is the one subject nats.go
// does emit here without a grant. The only emitter is the ordered consumer's
// reset path, which fires DeleteConsumer for the consumer it is replacing in
// a goroutine and ignores the result; the ephemeral it could not delete is
// reaped by the inactive threshold lib.TasksGet and lib.TaskInReplay set on it,
// lib.EphemeralConsumerInactiveThreshold (five seconds -- nats.go's own
// ordered default is five MINUTES, which is what the replay carried before
// gke-labs/kube-agents#1741). TasksGet does not delete its own replay
// consumer, and that is a decision rather than an omission: under this grant
// the delete is a refused publish on a subject with no reply, so the bridge
// would pay an Error-level permissions violation on every task it dispatches
// -- the line an operator is taught to read as a missing grant -- to reclaim
// the last five seconds of one consumer slot.
//
// Withholding it raises the price of reaching another principal's durable and
// does not close the route, which is the correction to what this comment said
// first. CONSUMER.CREATE is create-OR-UPDATE by name -- the request's `action`
// field is empty for both, and the server has no ownership concept for a
// consumer name -- so within a stream the bridge may create consumers on,
// every consumer on that stream is the bridge's to reconfigure. Measured
// against this render, on the gateway's relay durable: one permitted
// $JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.TASKS.gateway-relay carrying the durable's own
// config with filter_subject changed retunes it, and the gateway stops seeing
// task events with no permissions violation logged anywhere; the same subject
// carrying inactive_threshold has the server reap the durable, ack floor and
// all, while CONSUMER.DELETE is refused in the same run. That is the residue
// the web block below already records for web, on the one stream where
// another principal has a durable to aim at. It is not new -- $JS.API.>
// permitted all of it -- and no narrower grant exists: nats.go's ordered
// consumers take server-generated names, so the last token has to be `>`, and
// NATS wildcards match whole tokens, so a per-prefix grant matches a consumer
// literally named that. What closes it is the auth callout giving each
// principal its own user. DELETE stays out as the one destructive verb here
// that nothing on the bridge path needs: its one emitter ignores the result
// and the threshold gets there anyway, so the grant's absence costs a log
// line on a reset and up to five seconds of a consumer slot, not a behaviour.
//
// One route this list narrows but cannot close, because it lives in a request
// body: a push consumer's deliver_subject. CONSUMER.CREATE on TASKS (or on the
// KV bucket) lets the bridge ask the server to deliver that stream's messages
// onto any subject, and a stream whose subjects cover the deliver subject
// stores them -- under their ORIGINAL subjects, so this is not forgery (a
// topic or card read by subject never sees them) but it is a persisted write
// into a stream the bridge has no publish grant for, and with discard=old an
// eviction lever against it. The server delivers only once a subscription
// exists whose subject is EXACTLY the deliver subject: a push consumer
// registers through Sublist.registerNotification, which takes interest only
// from a match whose `sub.subject` is byte-equal to the deliver subject, and
// says so in its own doc comment ("this interest needs to be exact and ...
// wildcards will not trigger the notifications"). Identical in 2.10.29 and
// 2.14.5, and it is what bounds the residue: a principal watching the whole
// plane is not enough, and neither is a stream's own wildcard ingest.
// Measured on both versions, that splits the streams in two. TOPICS-STATE and
// TOPICS-JOURNAL have literal subjects, so their own ingest subscription IS
// the exact match and the write lands with no help (three TASKS messages
// arrived in TOPICS-STATE under a2a.tasks.* subjects). DIRECTORY, TASKS and
// the buckets have wildcard subjects, so a client has to hold a subscription
// on the deliver subject itself -- for the directory, another principal
// subscribed to one card subject. The gateway's `a2a.agents.>` and web's
// `a2a.>` subscribe grants permit that but do not supply it: a subscription
// on either wildcard leaves DIRECTORY empty, measured. Nothing in the tree
// opens a literal card subscription today. The wildcard this replaces had the
// same route with every stream as a source; what closes it is the bridge not
// holding CONSUMER.CREATE at all, which is a pre-created consumer per task
// (the stage-3 dispatcher), not a grant. The server test measures all four
// cases.

// off the wildcard in #1306 and worker in #1393, and with this one no
// rendered principal holds it.
//
// The gateway is the task requester, the chat-session supervisor and the
// session registry's owner. The wildcard covered STREAM.DELETE on every
// stream in the account, which #1666 measured live: one call as this user
// destroyed TASKS, taking every task's event history and its five live
// consumers with it, and the provision Job then recreated the stream empty on
// the next reconcile -- so the loss reads as healthy from the operator's side.
// It also made the ack scoping beside it moot. That grant is scoped to TASKS
// precisely so this user cannot +TERM another principal's in-flight delivery,
// and `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.TASKS.*` sat inside the wildcard the whole
// time.
//
// The list is what the gateway's own binaries emit, read out of nats.go
// v1.53.1 and then measured against a real server running this render
// (TestGatewayJetStreamGrantOnARealServer). Per stream:
//
//   - TASKS: STREAM.INFO (js.Stream, in lib.TasksGet), CONSUMER.CREATE (the
//     `gateway-relay` durable through CreateOrUpdateConsumer, and the
//     replay's ordered consumer), CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT (every pull on both),
//     and DIRECT.GET (GetLastMsgForSubject: tasks/get's replay horizon).
//     Acks are $JS.ACK.TASKS.>, granted beside this list.
//
//     CONSUMER.CREATE ends in `>` rather than naming the durable, and both
//     reasons are load-bearing. The relay carries TWO filter subjects
//     (`…events` and `…supervisor`, since the supervisor split), and nats.go
//     puts the filter in the API subject only when there is exactly one
//     (jetstream/consumer.go, apiConsumerCreateWithFilterSubjectT), so the
//     relay's own create is `CONSUMER.CREATE.TASKS.gateway-relay` while a
//     single-filter rebind would be four tokens longer. And the replay's
//     ordered consumers take server-generated names
//     (jetstream.go, OrderedConsumer, which seeds namePrefix from nuid.Next),
//     so no literal exists to name.
//
//   - KV_session-state, the session registry: STREAM.INFO (js.KeyValue binds
//     a bucket by reading its stream), DIRECT.GET (kv.Get, which every
//     registry read goes through -- Get, SessionForTask, and the reap scan's
//     per-key read), and CONSUMER.CREATE with CONSUMER.DELETE
//     (kv.ListKeysFiltered is a push ordered consumer that nats.go creates
//     and then deletes on Unsubscribe, and the reap loop runs it on a timer).
//     Create, Put and Delete are publishes on $KV.session-state.>, granted
//     beside this list.
//
// Reads go through DIRECT.GET and not STREAM.MSG.GET because every stream the
// provision script creates has allow_direct set: the script says
// --allow-direct on each `stream add`, and a KV bucket always has it. nats.go
// picks the route from the stream's own config (jetstream/stream.go, getMsg),
// so the fallback is never emitted and is not granted.
//
// What the wildcard granted that nothing on the gateway path uses, and this
// list now refuses: STREAM.DELETE, PURGE, UPDATE, MSG.DELETE, RESTORE and
// SNAPSHOT on every stream, #1666's TASKS deletion included; every verb on
// DIRECTORY (the gateway keeps SUBSCRIBE on the cards, which is the read
// discovery needs), on KV_runtime-state and on KV_cap; every verb on the two
// topic streams, which nothing in a2a/gateway touches; STREAM.CREATE;
// enumeration (STREAM.NAMES, STREAM.LIST, CONSUMER.NAMES, CONSUMER.LIST); and
// account INFO, which jetstream.New never asks for.
//
// CONSUMER.INFO is withheld, and it is worth stating because it costs
// something. Nothing on the gateway path binds a consumer by name -- the
// relay is CreateOrUpdateConsumer, the replay is an ordered consumer -- and on
// nats.go v1.53.1 neither re-verifies itself with Info() after a reconnect
// either: the Consume status loop re-issues a pull on CONNECTED, and the
// ordered consumer's reset is a CONSUMER.CREATE. TestGatewayConsumersSurviveABusRestart
// holds that across a server restart rather than resting on the reading. What
// it costs is that the gateway can no longer read back the state of a
// consumer it owns, which is a diagnostic it never used and the `web` user
// still holds.
//
// CONSUMER.DELETE on TASKS is withheld too, and it is the one subject nats.go
// emits here without a grant. The only emitter is the ordered consumer's
// reset path, which fires DeleteConsumer in a goroutine and ignores the
// result (jetstream/ordered.go, reset). What it buys is removing this user's
// route to another principal's durable by name -- a session pod's three
// consumers included -- and it is not free. Two costs, both on the reset path
// and neither on the steady state:
//
//   - The refused request reaches nats.go's async error handler, which in
//     a2a/lib's client logs at Error level (a2a/lib/client.go, the
//     ErrorHandler option). So a bus bounce or a heartbeat gap while N
//     tasks/get replays are in flight writes N "permissions violation for
//     publish to $JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.TASKS.<name>" lines into the
//     gateway's own log, for a refusal that is by design. Measured in
//     TestGatewayConsumersSurviveABusRestart, which asserts that this is the
//     only violation the restart produces.
//   - The pre-reset ephemeral is not removed immediately; it waits out the
//     inactive threshold lib.TasksGet sets on it,
//     lib.EphemeralConsumerInactiveThreshold (five seconds; nats.go's own
//     ordered-consumer default is five minutes, which is what the replay
//     carried before gke-labs/kube-agents#1741), holding a TASKS consumer
//     slot against max_consumers. Stopping an ordered iterator never deleted
//     its consumer under the wildcard either, so the per-replay ephemeral is
//     pre-existing -- what this adds is that the RESET path's old consumer
//     lingers too. Measured on the rendered config: a reconnect that leaves
//     the server running holds two slots per replay in flight, the old
//     consumer and its replacement, until the threshold expires; a bus
//     bounce leaves only the replacement, because these consumers are memory
//     storage with one replica and the restarting server drops them. Those
//     slots are the gateway's and never a session's, which is why TASKS'
//     max_consumers counts tasks/get replays beside the session cap:
//     a2aTasksReplayConsumers, in the reserve, derives the number from the
//     callers. A budget that counted sessions alone ran out under replay
//     load and refused a legitimate session's consumer create, which read
//     as an undersized stream.
//
// Neither is worth the grant, but the cost is stated rather than described as
// free, which is what this comment said first.
//
// Two routes this list narrows but cannot close, both recorded here because
// they survive any per-stream scoping of a principal that may create
// consumers at all. CONSUMER.CREATE is create-OR-UPDATE by name and the
// server has no ownership concept for a consumer name, so within TASKS every
// consumer is this user's to reconfigure or to have reaped through an
// inactive_threshold it sets -- measured for `bridge` in
// a2aBridgeJetStreamGrants, identical here. And a push consumer's
// deliver_subject is a body field no subject grant can see. Neither is new;
// $JS.API.> permitted both, with every stream as a source rather than one.
// What closes them is per-task consumers created by the dispatcher, not a
// grant. The gateway is also the principal these residues matter least for:
// it is the requester and the supervisor, so it already writes the task plane

# 4222 from the enumerated bus clients, 9222 from the console server alone,
# and no pod-network peer for 8222. The console server is admitted because it
# is the page's proxy. A browser reaches it through a kubectl port-forward and
# it forwards the websocket here with the browser's headers intact. It is not
# an in-cluster door for anything else. A port-forward straight to 9222 still
# works for local tooling and the live tests, because it enters from the
# node, which NetworkPolicy does not govern. Production still terminates TLS
# in front of the bus, which is not a toggle that exists yet.

// harmless against 32 random hex characters, an offline target the day a
// password is hand-set, and CodeQL alert 27 (go/weak-sensitive-data-hashing).

// Instead it covers the conf rendered with a placeholder in each password's

// the placeholder render tracks every non-secret byte, so a config change still
// rolls the bus, and the resourceVersion tracks a credential rotation, which

//
// The hash is no longer content-addressed. resourceVersion moves on ANY
// accepted write to the creds Secret, so labelling it by hand, a policy

// rolls the single-replica bus once with nothing the server reads having
// changed — clients reconnect, and JetStream state lives on the PV. An unkeyed
// digest of the password bytes would ignore metadata churn but is the alert
// this function exists to close, so the spurious roll is the price of not
// hashing the credential. secretEnvHash (platformagent_secret_hash.go) has
// since shown a third way — an HMAC over the values keyed by the Secret's UID,
// which ignores metadata churn without an unkeyed digest — and moving this
// function onto it is a separate change: it alters when the bus rolls under
// mode: next and needs its own live test.
//
// And the rotation it notices rolls the bus, not the bus's clients. This hash
// rides the NATS pod template alone; the gateway Deployment takes its password
// through valueFrom.secretKeyRef, which a running pod does not re-read. The
// gateway is covered separately: its pod template carries the secret-env digest
// (stampSecretEnvHash in reconcileA2A), which moves when its password's value
// does, within secretEnvReprobeInterval. The provision Job holds no password: it

NATS="nats --server ` + server + ` --user ${BUS_USER} --password ${BUS_TOKEN} --inbox-prefix=_INBOX.provision"

# max_consumers caps each stream. Consumer durability is a request-body
# field, so no permission list can hold web to ephemeral ones (see the web user
# in nats.conf); the cap is what stops an unreapable durable per page-load from
# growing the file store without bound. The failure it converts to is loud — a
# refused create — rather than silent disk growth. Note the trade: a client that
# burns the cap can also deny a legitimate consumer, which is the right way
# round for a playground and the wrong one for production, where the callout
# mints per-identity users and this becomes a per-user limit instead.
#
# Three streams keep the flat 64. TASKS does not: it is the one stream session
# pods create consumers on, three apiece, so its cap is derived from this CR's
# maxSessions (a2aTasksMaxConsumers) and a stream that cannot hold the
# configured concurrency is a refusal below rather than a task failure at load.

# Retention rule (deployment spec): acknowledgement must not delete — all
# message streams are limits-based with an age window; replay is a read.
# Every stream carries a hard max_bytes with discard old so a flood degrades
# replay oldest-first instead of filling the PV and stalling JetStream.
#
# --allow-direct is stated on every stream even though it is the CLI's
# default: the bus grants are written for the direct-get
# route (nats.go picks DIRECT.GET or STREAM.MSG.GET from the stream's own
# config), so the bit the grant rests on is set here, not inherited.

# TASKS: a2a.tasks.>, 72h dev window, 20GiB cap.
#
# max_msgs_per_subject bounds ONE SUBJECT, which on this stream is one class of
# one task: a2a.tasks.{addressee}.{taskId}.{in,events,supervisor}. Read what it
# does and does not buy, because the two are easy to swap.
#
# It buys: a runaway executor - a loop, a harness streaming forever - can no
# longer push 20GiB through the stream on one task and, with discard=old, evict
# every other session's history on the way. The runaway now pays for its own
# runaway and nobody else's.
#
# It does NOT buy containment of a session that means it. A session's publish
# grant is a2a.tasks.<pod>.*.events (authcallout/session.go, sessionGrants: the
# task id is not in the attested claim, so the grant cannot name one), so a
# session can mint unbounded distinct subjects by inventing task ids. A
# per-subject cap is not a per-publisher budget, and JetStream has no per-
# publisher budget to reach for. Closing that means putting the task id in the
# claim, which is a change to the callout's narrowing and not to a stream flag.
#
# 4096, sized against the publisher that means it rather than the well-behaved
# one: the render sets no max_payload, so NATS' 1MiB default is the per-message
# ceiling and 4096 messages is a ~4GiB worst case on one subject, a fifth of the
# stream. The worker adapter's own result chunks are resultChunkSize (256 KiB),
# so a task built out of those reaches nearer 1GiB at the same count - but that
# is a property of one publisher and not a bound the bus enforces. A chat-driven
# task emits single digits to low hundreds of events; reaching 4096 is already a
# loop or a gigabyte of streamed artifact text.
#
# What happens at the limit, because discard=old evicts the OLDEST message on
# the subject first: the oldest event on a task's ...events subject is its
# 'submitted' status-update, which assertion 9 requires and which FoldTask
# folds into StatusHistory[0]. A truncated task therefore replays without its
# head. That is only acceptable because the fold now SAYS so - lib.Task's
# SubmittedMissing is the assertion-9 observation, the sibling of
# PostFinalDropped for assertion 10 - so the eviction is a degradation a reader
# can see rather than a short history it cannot distinguish from a real one.
#
# The same eviction on the ...in class is quieter and worse, and this flag
# does not ship without the check that answers it. That subject's oldest
# message is the task's originating kind:message, which the worker re-reads on
# every start. Steers are kind:message too and nothing on the envelope marks
# the submission, so a scan past the cap returns the oldest surviving steer and
# the worker executes that as the request - with no SubmittedMissing to show
# for it, because nothing folds ...in. No stream flag closes that: per-subject
# discard:new would refuse the steer instead of the submission, which breaks
# steering, and there is no 'keep the head' policy. It is closed on the client
# side instead. The gateway publishes the submission before it spawns the pod,
# so the ack names the sequence; it passes that to the pod as A2A_ORIGIN_SEQ
# and the adapter opens its origin consumer there and refuses to run if the
# message it gets back is a different sequence. See a2a/worker-adapter
# fetchOriginAtSeq and docs/designs/spec-nats-deployment.md.

# TASKS older than this render: the limits the create above could not apply.
#
# Provisioning is create-only convergence - the info-then-add guards never
# edit an existing stream, which buildA2AProvisionJob says in terms - so an
# install whose TASKS predates a limit keeps the stream it was created with
# and gains nothing from a re-run. Both limits this render puts on TASKS are
# in exactly that position on every install that already has the stream, and
# the two gaps are not the same kind:
#
#   max_consumers short is a capacity shortfall with a load-time failure
#   attached. A legitimate session's consumer create is refused, surfaced as
#   a task failure, with nothing in it pointing at the stream. Worth
#   refusing over here, where the number that caused it is in hand.
#
#   max_msgs_per_subject absent is a missing bound, not a broken one: the
#   install behaves exactly as it did before this render carried the flag.
#   Applying it would be a TIGHTENING, and a tightening evicts: a
#   stream edit that lowers max_msgs_per_subject drops every message over
#   the new limit on every subject the moment it lands. Truncating a running
#   install's task history as an automatic side effect of an operator
#   upgrade is not a decision this script takes on an operator's behalf. It
#   reports, names the edit and what the edit costs, and moves on.
#
# This runs LAST, after every other stream and bucket, so the refusal below
# leaves a fully provisioned bus short one limit rather than a bus missing
# DIRECTORY, the topic streams and the KV buckets. The refusal is reached on
# an operator upgrade alone, with no CR edit involved - an install already
# running maxSessions above what its stream holds has been under-provisioned
# the whole time, and this is the first thing that says so.

// buildA2AProvisionJob runs the provisioning script against the rendered NATS.
// The name carries a digest of the rendered spec (a2aProvisionJobName) so a
// changed render is a new Job — Jobs are immutable — and completed runs clean
// themselves up via TTL. The TTL has a known cost, chosen not overlooked: once
// it removes the Job, the next reconcile's create-if-absent re-runs the
// (idempotent) script under the same name, so a standing next install
// re-proves its provisioning roughly daily. Re-proving is not all it does.
// The TTL removes a FAILED Job on the same clock, and the closing block's
// max_consumers refusal is deterministic and now fails the Job from its
// first pod (the podFailurePolicy below), so the daily re-create is the only
// thing that ever re-checks that refusal — against a stream an operator has
// since recreated, or a maxSessions -- or a declared bridge worker count --
// that has come down to fit the stream that is there. That churn is one short-lived pod a day; the alternative —
// a Job kept forever as the done-marker — trades it for permanent clutter, a
// stale-looking object in every kubectl listing, and a refusal that never
// looks again.
//
// The digest covers everything this function renders into the spec: the
// script, the image, the uid and security contexts, env, volumes, mounts,
// backoffLimit, the restart and pod failure policies, and the TTL. What becomes of the generation the render has
// moved past depends on how far that generation got, and one case is why the
// rename on its own is not enough. A completed one leaves by TTL; one whose
// pod ran and failed runs out its backoffLimit and then leaves by TTL; one
// whose pod never ran — an unpullable image, an unschedulable pod, an
// admission refusal — has no terminal condition for the TTL to start from
// and would sit in Pending until the mode flips or the agent is deleted,
// holding one slot in the namespace pod quota the whole time. That last case
// is the image override scenario this digest exists for, and it is why
// reconcileA2A sweeps superseded generations by label, keeping only the
// current render's name (deleteA2AProvisionJobs), after ensuring the Job this
// function builds rather than before it — so a reconcile leaves N+1 of them
// for a moment, never zero. Two things hold alongside that sweep: the status
// scan in reconcileA2A reads the current name only, so a Failed condition on
// a generation the sweep is about to remove never reaches the phase, and
// cleanupA2A calls the same function keeping nothing, so a mode flip removes
// every generation at once.
//
// What the digest does not cover is what is on the bus. Creation is
// create-only convergence: the script's `info || add` lines make re-runs
// clean but do NOT edit a stream that already exists, so a retention or
// subject change in a later payload reaches fresh installs only. Migrating an
// existing install is a manual `nats stream edit` — stage 1 accepts that and
// says it here rather than implying the digest-rename re-provisions.

				// The remedy is the second half, and it is conditional

				// nothing else — the closing block's refusal, the one
				// a re-run cannot clear — and the Job controller

				// BackoffLimitExceeded. Naming the consumer remedy on
				// that one would tell an operator whose NATS is simply
				// down to lower their concurrency or delete a stream,
				// so it goes out only on the refusal it fixes; the pod
				// log still says what happened either way.
				//
				// No way out it names is a stream edit, because
				// max_consumers is the one limit nats-server will not
				// change on a stream that exists — an update carrying
				// a different MaxConsumers comes back "stream
				// configuration update can not change MaxConsumers",
				// and the bus this operator renders is pinned to

				// lowering maxSessions until the budget fits the
				// stream — or, where the CR declares a bridge sidecar
				// with more workers than the bridge's default, its
				// worker count, which the message offers only then —
				// or deleting TASKS and letting the script
				// recreate it — the create-only guards create every
				// stream they do not find, ahead of these checks — at
				// the cost of the task history the stream is holding.
				//
				// They do not finish the same way, and the message
				// says so rather than making one claim about all of
				// them. Lowering maxSessions, or the worker count,
				// edits the CR, which re-renders
				// the provision script, which moves the digest the Job
				// name carries (a2aProvisionJobName) — a new Job, and
				// it runs by itself. Deleting TASKS changes nothing
				// the operator reads, so that half needs the Job
				// re-run, and then a restart of the two long-lived
				// clients that held a durable consumer on the stream:
				// deleting a stream deletes its consumers, and neither
				// the gateway's relay nor the Hermes bridge sidecar
				// re-creates one. Both subscribe through
				// lib.Client.SubscribeDurable, whose Consume call
				// passes no jetstream.ConsumeErrHandler, so nats.go
				// treats the deleted consumer as terminal, stops the
				// subscription and returns nothing to log — the same
				// failure the worker adapter grew a supervisor for.
				// An operator who recreates the stream and stops there
				// has a gateway still accepting delegations and
				// spawning session pods while relaying no events, a
				// bridge dispatching nothing, and a CR reading Ready.
				// The order is in the message because restarting
				// before the stream is back just fails the subscribe.

				// Of the three numbers that remedy wants, only two are

				// creates, which floors at the cap TASKS shipped with,
				// so a default install needs 62 and recreates at 64.

	//
	// Creation only, and the distinction is the whole design. A callout that
	// goes unready under a running install must not take the gateway with it:
	// that would turn an ordering guarantee into a liveness coupling, and
	// every in-flight session hangs off the gateway Deployment's UID. So an
	// existing gateway is reconciled normally no matter what the condition
	// says, and only the FIRST creation waits.
	//
	// It used to read the published condition, so that the gate and the
	// signal an operator watches could not disagree. They now can, on
	// purpose, because they answer different questions. BusCredentialsReady
	// asks "is the callout as a whole serving map V": every replica ready and
	// on the current template, which is the right claim for the operator
	// reading it and stays as strict as it is. The gate asks "can a new
	// gateway safely connect right now", and the callout's replicas form a
	// NATS queue group (a2a/authcallout/service.go, AuthQueueGroup), so ONE
	// replica serving the current map already answers every authorization
	// request a session pod will make. Importing the all-replicas rule here
	// held a first gateway indefinitely on a callout whose second pod could
	// not schedule -- a namespace quota with no headroom, node pressure, an
	// image pull failing on one node -- on a bus that would have authenticated

	// in the teardown sequence:
	//
	//   - the StatefulSet, which is deleted LAST below, so its absence means an

	//   - the gateway Deployment, which the render creates last and this
	//     function deletes first, so it catches a pass that failed immediately,
	//   - the NATS fence and the session fence, for the render that never
	//     reaches reconcileA2A. reconcileAgentNetworkGuardrails applies the
	//     fences on every refusal under mode next, so a CR refused on its
	//     first reconcile has the fences and none of the other objects here;
	//     without these two the exit stepped over them on the flip to today
	//     (#2197). The NATS fence is the first object that path writes, so a
	//     guardrail render that died anywhere leaves it; the session fence is
	//     the last fence the teardown deletes, so a cleanup pass that died
	//     between the two leaves it,
	//   - the inject door's fence, for the shape neither of those two covers.
	//     It is written after both and deleted before both, so a render or a
	//     cleanup that dies partway always leaves one of the two standing
	//     beside it. The hand does not die partway: an operator triaging an
	//     EgressAllowlistRefused who deletes the NATS and session fences and
	//     flips the CR to today before the reconcile that delete enqueued has
	//     re-applied them hands the first today reconcile a tree holding the
	//     inject fence alone. Nothing on the today path but this walk removes
	//     it -- removeA2AInjectBackend runs from the next render only -- so
	//     without this entry the exit returned, and did so again on every
	//     reconcile after, over an owned A2A NetworkPolicy. Listed whatever
	//     the flag says, like its teardown entry: the install that has it is
	//     the one whose operator was deployed with the flag, and the read
	//     finds nothing on one that never was,
	//   - the A2A door's fence, the same shape under the other flag: written
	//     after the pair and deleted before it, left alone only by the hand,
	//     removed on the today path by nothing but this walk,
	//   - the console fence, for the same hand on an install without the
	//     inject flag. It is the third fence reconcileA2ANetworkFences writes,
	//     so the same two deletes leave it standing alone there, and nothing
	//     on the today path but this walk removes it either,
	//   - the callout keys Secret, which is the FIRST deletable object
	//     reconcileA2A creates — the per-user creds Secret is created before it
	//     and deliberately survives — so a render that died anywhere leaves this
	//     one behind. It covers the identity-map ConfigMap created right after
	//     it for the same reason,
	//   - the config Secret, which held that role before the callout existed.
	//     Kept for the install whose partial render predates the keys Secret:
	//     an operator upgraded across this change and then flipped to `today`
	//     would otherwise step over a config Secret no later object accompanies.
	//
	// Without the Secrets and the fences the exit would step over those objects
	// and leave an A2A object on a `today` install, which is the darkness
	// property. The first six are Owns kinds and free; the two Secret reads
	// are uncached and happen only when the free six all miss.
	//
	// A sentinel counts only when this CR owns it: a squatted or stale-UID
	// object under a reserved name is not residue of this CR and is left to
	// its owner or to the garbage collector. The walk below refuses to delete
	// anything this CR does not own, so a present-but-unowned sentinel that
	// counted would send every reconcile of a today install into that refusal
	// -- the shape a next CR deleted and re-created under the same name in
	// today mode takes, while its old fences still carry the old UID.
	// Ownership is read off the fetched object, so the exit stays at eight
	// Gets.
	//
	// Adding an object to reconcileA2A ahead of the keys Secret, or to
	// reconcileA2ANetworkFences ahead of the NATS fence, means adding it here.
	// TestTheEarlyExitSeesTheResidueOfARenderThatDiedAnywhere walks every
	// prefix of both renders and is what makes forgetting it red rather than
	// silent: without the keys Secret below, its writes 3 and 4 fail, and
	// without the fences every guardrail prefix does. The inject, door and
