// The bus principals, in one place, as data.
//
// This list is the single source for three renders that MUST agree: the
// nats.conf user blocks for the principals that still authenticate statically,
// the auth callout's identity-to-permissions map for the ones that authenticate
// with a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token, and the NATS_USER a client is handed
// so it can set the inbox prefix its own grants require. Before the callout,
// those three lived in a config string, a Secret and a container env block, and
// nothing but review connected them. A grant list that disagrees with the user
// name in any of the three produces a client that authenticates, publishes, and
// then hangs forever on a reply its subscribe grant does not cover — the
// hardest failure in this deployment to read from the outside, and the one W6
// found twice.
//
// Deny-by-default is unchanged: arming the callout changed who vouches for an
// identity, not what that identity may say. What this change does move is the
// session: it is a principal of its own now, it authenticates through the
// callout, and it is off the shared worker credential. `worker` itself is gone
// — A5 split it into the two workloads that were sharing it, `agent` and
// `bridge`, and TestTheWorkerCredentialIsGone refuses its return.

	// denyPublish and denySubscribe are subtracted from the allow lists

	//
	// A deny is strictly worse than a narrow allow and is not a substitute
	// for one. It is here because `gateway` holds `$JS.API.>` — the whole
	// JetStream API, on every stream — and narrowing that is a change to how
	// the gateway talks to JetStream, which is gke-labs#1306's work and not
	// this card's. What this card cannot ship without is the one subtraction
	// the capability design rests on: nobody but the verifier reads the cap
	// bucket. So the deny is scoped to that bucket, and the wide allow it
	// carves out of stays a recorded debt rather than becoming invisible.
	//
	// `worker` carries the same pair as defence in depth. #1316 enumerated
	// that principal by stream name, so nothing in its allow list reaches the
	// cap bucket today and the deny subtracts nothing — which is precisely
	// why it is written down: #1306 will be asked to widen these lists, and a
	// widening must not be able to hand the capability store out on the way
	// past.
	//
	// `seed` deliberately has NO deny, and the reason is the one thing a
	// positional deny cannot express. Its entries match on stream name at a
	// fixed depth, so `$JS.API.STREAM.CREATE.KV_cap` is denied by the same
	// pattern as `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.KV_cap` — and seed is a PROVISIONER.
	// a2aSeedJetStreamGrants grants it CREATE and INFO on every provisioned
	// stream so the `kv info cap || kv add cap` guard in the provision script
	// works on a fresh store; a deny there does not make that guard fail
	// loudly, it makes each refused request wait out natscli's 5s timeout,
	// which is the failure mode that function's own comment was written
	// about. Nothing is given up: post-#1316 seed's allow list holds no
	// DIRECT.GET, no STREAM.MSG.GET and no CONSUMER verb on any bucket, and
	// its subscribe list is two exact prefixes, so it cannot read an entry
	// with or without the deny.
	//
	// Rendered only for static principals. No callout principal needs one:
	// provision's JetStream grants are enumerated the same way seed's are,
	// the session's are derived at mint time, and the verifier is the reader.

// a2aCapBucketReadDeny is every JetStream API subject that could read, copy or
// snapshot the cap bucket, and the subscribe on its live writes.
//
// Positional rather than enumerated by verb. The stream name lands at one of
// two depths in the JetStream API — `$JS.API.DIRECT.GET.KV_cap` and
// `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.KV_cap` put it fourth, `$JS.API.STREAM.MSG.GET.KV_cap`
// and `$JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.KV_cap.<consumer>` put it fifth — so covering
// both depths with and without a trailing token covers the API's shape instead
// of a list of verbs somebody has to keep current. A future NATS release that
// adds a read verb is covered the day it ships; an enumeration would not be.
//
// It denies the write verbs at those depths too (STREAM.DELETE, PURGE, UPDATE),
// which is not the property under test but is free and correct: only the
// provision Job creates this bucket, and only the gateway and the session pods
// write entries — and both of those write by publishing to `$KV.cap.…`
// directly, never through the stream API. That is why the Minter deliberately
// does not bind the bucket: binding is a `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.KV_cap` read,
// and a writer that needed one could not be denied here.
//
// $KV.cap.> on the subscribe side closes the other door. Denying the API path

// 09 §4 gives read to exactly one component and this is the entry that makes

// and no fourth: bind the bucket, and get a message by sequence on either the
// direct-get path or the stream path. No CONSUMER surface — a consumer on
// KV_cap delivering into a subject this principal can subscribe to would be a
// live feed of every capability minted, which is the one thing the whole
// no-crypto scheme depends on nobody having.

// the bus, so the grant could not be scoped to one inbox, and under _INBOX it
// would have covered `_INBOX.gateway.>` — where the gateway reads its
// JetStream replies. The verifier could have forged a stream acknowledgement
// to the component that creates streams. A namespace of its own costs one
// subscribe grant per caller and takes that away.
//
// CALLOUT, not static, and unlike the gateway there is no sequencing excuse
// to make: this program is new and presents a projected token from its first
// commit. The component that can read every capability in flight should not

// bridge: the Hermes bridge sidecar, executor for the `platform` addressee.

// The other half of `worker`. The bridge is a passthrough that makes the
// platform agent reachable on the bus: it consumes a2a.tasks.platform.*.in,
// runs Hermes as a subprocess, and publishes the result on
// a2a.tasks.platform.*.events (a2a/hermes-bridge/bridge.go).
//
// STATIC, and the reason is a property of the mechanism rather than a schedule.
// The bridge is a container in the AGENT pod — it execs the Hermes binary
// against the agent's profile state on the agent's PVC, so it cannot move to a
// pod of its own — and the callout resolves an identity from a ServiceAccount
// token, which the API server issues per pod. One pod is one ServiceAccount, so
// a token would give the bridge and the agent container the SAME entry: the
// union of a blackboard reader and a task-plane executor, which is `worker`
// again under a better name. A static password is what keeps them two
// principals.
//
// Not an absolute about tokens -- an absolute about THIS callout. It keys its
// map on the ServiceAccount alone (a2a/authcallout/service.go) and derives
// Narrowing from the pod, so neither field distinguishes two containers that
// share one. A map keyed on (ServiceAccount, audience) would, since a container
// cannot read a volume projected into its neighbour; that is the shape to reach
// for if the bridge ever needs a token before it leaves the pod, and it is
// unbuilt because the bridge is the only workload that would use it.
//
// Narrower than `worker` on the axis a subject grant can narrow, and NOT on the
// other one. Publishing task events is scoped to the one addressee the bridge
// serves rather than `a2a.tasks.*.*`, so it can no longer speak for a session
// pod's task. That narrowing is real and measured.
//
// Reading is not narrowed. The core subscribe is the `platform` inbound leg
// rather than `a2a.tasks.>`, but the JetStream half of the list reaches the
// whole stream by two routes a subject grant cannot scope:
// `$JS.API.DIRECT.GET.TASKS.>` takes the message subject as its trailing token,
// and CONSUMER.CREATE + MSG.NEXT carries filter_subject in the REQUEST BODY, so
// a consumer filtered on `a2a.tasks.>` is permitted by a grant that names only
// the stream. Both are in TestBridgeJetStreamGrantOnARealServer's allowed
// table, measured on the bridge's own addressee: what makes them unscoped is
// the shape of the two routes, not anything that test crosses -- its one
// cross-addressee row is the refused events WRITE. A holder of
// `bridge-password` can therefore drain every session's prompts off TASKS.
// Not a regression -- `worker` held the identical two grants -- and not
// closable by editing this list: what closes it is the bridge not holding
// CONSUMER.CREATE at all, which is a pre-created consumer per task (the stage-3
// dispatcher), the same answer the deliver_subject residue gets in
// a2aBridgeJetStreamGrants' comment.
//
// Dropped rather than carried across: `agents.hb.>`. Nothing in the tree

// say so — and the bridge is explicitly not the thing that would.
