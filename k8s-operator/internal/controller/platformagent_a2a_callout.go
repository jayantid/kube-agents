// The auth callout Deployment.
//
// It sits ON the connection path: while it is down no NEW connection to the bus
// succeeds, though every established one keeps working. That shapes almost
// everything below — two replicas, a readiness probe that reports whether the
// map is actually being served, a liveness probe that deliberately does not,
// and a rollout that never takes both replicas out at once.
//
// The blast radius, stated honestly rather than implied: during a callout
// outage the fabric is dark to new work — no new sessions, no new workers — not
// gracefully degraded. Established connections and the client resilience
// contract are what make that acceptable at this stage. A hardened HA callout
// is production posture, not part of the dev toggle.

// a2aIdentityMapSchemaAnnotation carries a2aIdentityMapSchema onto the callout
// pod template.
const a2aIdentityMapSchemaAnnotation = "a2a.kubeagents.x-k8s.io/identity-map-schema"

// a2aIdentityMapSchema is the version of the rendered identity map's SHAPE, not
// of its contents. It is on the callout's pod template, so a release that
// changes the shape rolls the callout exactly once.
//
// Why it has to exist. The callout parses with DisallowUnknownFields, on
// purpose: a key it does not recognise is a grant or a narrowing it cannot
// enforce, and serving the map anyway would enforce less than the operator
// rendered. The cost of that strictness is that the two cannot skew across a
// field addition -- and nothing else in this Deployment's spec changes when the
// map does, so on an upgrade where the callout image reference is unchanged
// (the default is a mutable tag) the old pods are never rolled. They refuse
// every new map on the unknown field, keep serving the last one they accepted,
// keep their readiness probe green, and BusCredentialsReady goes on reporting
// True while naming a version no replica has. Measured on a2a-next-dev,
// 2026-09-14: operator upgraded alone, callout generation unchanged at 8, CR
// claiming `6ce6662285534d95` while both replicas served `c3017a17889c5f45`
// with `lastError: unknown field "narrowing"`, and every session refused with
// "platform-agent-a2a-session is not in the identity map".
//
// What rolling buys is not that the new pods can read the map -- with a
// mutable tag they pull a binary that can, but that is the registry's doing,
// not ours. It is that a pod which refuses its FIRST map has no previous one to
// fall back on, so Store.Ready is false, /readyz answers 503 `no identity map:
// ...`, the Deployment never goes Available and the rollout stops with the
// reason on the pod. The silent case only exists because the refusing replica
// was already serving something. Rolling removes the fallback, and with it the
// silence.
//
// Rolling the callout on every map CHANGE was considered and rejected -- see
// platformagent_a2a_buscreds.go, the callout is on the connection path and a
// restart is a window where new connections fail. This is the narrow version of
// that trade: once per release that changes the map's shape, never for a
// routine identity edit. A bounded window during an upgrade is worth a
// permanent one after it.
//
// Bump this when the rendered map gains, renames or removes a field, and add
// the new key set to a2aIdentityMapSchemaKeys in the test beside it.

//
// Why the operator needs `bind` at all, measured rather than reasoned: the
// operator has held unscoped create/update/patch/delete on clusterroles and
// clusterrolebindings since long before this callout existed, so `bind` is not
// standing in for a grant it lacks. What stops that CRUD from being a general
// escalation is the API server's escalation check plus the absence of
// `escalate`. system:auth-delegator grants subjectaccessreviews/create, which
// the operator does NOT hold — so without `bind` the API server refuses the
// binding outright:
//
//	clusterrolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "..." is forbidden: user
//	"system:serviceaccount:kubeagents-system:kubeagents-controller" is
//	attempting to grant RBAC permissions not currently held:
//	{APIGroups:["authorization.k8s.io"], Resources:["subjectaccessreviews"],
//	Verbs:["create"]}
//
// That grant is therefore load-bearing, and scoped by resourceNames to this one
// role so it cannot attach cluster-admin to anything.
//
// What it costs, and the alternative it was chosen over: system:auth-delegator
// also carries subjectaccessreviews/create, which the callout never calls. An
// operator-authored ClusterRole holding only tokenreviews/create would give the
// callout exactly what it uses and would need no new operator permission at all
// — the operator already holds tokenreviews/create, so the escalation check
// passes (verified by server-side dry run against a cluster with no `bind`
// rule: the tokenreviews-only role is admitted, a subjectaccessreviews one is
// refused). Binding the role kube-apiserver ships is the conventional pattern
// for a TokenReview client and keeps the grant auditable by name in role.yaml,
// which is why it is what ships; the narrower option is tracked as #1320.
//
// It is part of kube-apiserver's default RBAC bootstrap, so it exists on every

// no business seeing any other ConfigMap in the namespace, and a namespace-wide
// read would make its token a lever on everything else in there.
//
// **This Role works only because the informer lists and watches with a
// metadata.name field selector, and that coupling is invisible from either
// side.** The widely-repeated rule is that resourceNames cannot restrict list
// or watch, because a collection request names no resource — and that used to
// be the whole story. Since selector-aware authorization the API server matches
// resourceNames against a metadata.name field selector, so a narrowed LIST is
// authorized where a bare one is refused. Measured against a real API server at
// 1.36 rather than taken from the documentation, because the documented
// folklore says this Role should not work:
//
//	GET  themap                              -> allowed
//	LIST configmaps?metadata.name=themap     -> allowed
//	LIST configmaps                          -> forbidden
//	WATCH configmaps?metadata.name=themap    -> allowed
//
// Two consequences. Do not "fix" this Role by widening it to namespace-wide
// list/watch — it is not broken. And do not drop the field selector from
// Store.WatchConfigMap, which would turn the informer's LIST into the bare form
// and get it refused. The pairing is asserted by
// TestTheCalloutRoleAuthorizesTheInformerItIsPairedWith.
//
// The version floor this implies is real: on a cluster predating selector-aware
// authorization the LIST is refused, the informer never syncs, the callout never
// serves a map and its readiness probe stays red. That is a loud failure with
// BusCredentialsReady false and a named error in the log, not a silent one —
