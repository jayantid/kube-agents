// The credential proxy: the pod that holds every credential the agent is not
// allowed to see.
//
// It is a Deployment of its own, always. No setting places it in the agent's
// gateway Pod or in the shell sandbox's StatefulSet, because the pod is the
// smallest unit that has an IP and an IP is what GKE resolves Workload Identity
// by. A credential runtime sharing a pod with model-authored code lets that code
// curl 169.254.169.254 and mint the runtime's own GSA token — every credential
// the proxy holds, with the policy layer bypassed entirely. Neither gVisor nor
// NetworkPolicy nor automountServiceAccountToken:false closes that: gVisor's
// boundary is the host kernel rather than the network, runtimeClassName and
// NetworkPolicy are both pod-scoped, and Workload Identity does not read the
// projected token file.
//
// Callers reach it over a ClusterIP on credentialProxyPort and are authenticated
// by TokenReview against CREDENTIAL_PROXY_ALLOWED_CALLERS, which names the
// ServiceAccounts it will serve. buildCredentialProxyNetworkPolicy narrows who
// can open the connection at all, wherever the CNI enforces one.
//
// The boundary costs the proxy a shared working tree. A separate pod cannot
// mount the sandbox's ReadWriteOnce claim, so `git` here operates on the proxy's
// own state volume rather than on the shell's checkout, and a wrapped command
// that names a host path has to pass the content rather than the filename. The
// version-control abstraction is what settles this rather than working around
// it: local git stays in the sandbox against a remoteless checkout, and only the
// remote operations cross to this pod.
//
// spec.security.workloadIdentityFederation is optional hardening on top. It
// moves this pod's cloud identity off the metadata server and onto a projected
// token file: the pod's ServiceAccount carries no iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account
// annotation, so the metadata server answers with an unbound
// <project>.svc.id.goog principal that IAM grants nothing, and the provider's
// attribute conditions bound what the exchange can mint. It narrows what this
// pod may mint; it does not decide where the pod runs.
//
// The split is by role rather than by copy: the same image runs here and in the
// gateway Pod's agent-api-auth container, with CREDENTIAL_PROXY_ROLE selecting
// which of its three services start. See deploy/shared/start-services.sh, and
// the design in docs/designs/agent-shell-sandboxing.md.

	// CPU is sized for a cold pod. After an eviction the replacement passes
	// its readiness probe five seconds in, and the first mints then arrive
	// while gcloud and the Minty client are still warming up, each bounded by
	// GCLOUD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS and MINTY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS in
	// agents/platform/scripts/github_token_refresh.py. Observed on Autopilot,
	// the composition's default, where a pod without bursting has its CPU
	// limit clamped to its request: at 100m the request was the ceiling, the
	// calls timed out for minutes after a start and one throttled pod kept
	// timing out for over an hour. 500m lets a mint finish inside its timeout
	// while the pod warms. On Standard the ceiling is the 1-CPU limit and the
	// request is scheduling weight, which matters only on a contended node.
	//
	// Memory is set by the CPU. Nothing here holds cluster state. What the
	// container holds is Envoy (53 to 66Mi resident on a live install, 85Mi in
	// the report that led to the bounds below), the broker process, and one
	// child process per in-flight request. The broker's own share is bounded:
	// credential_proxy.py keeps at most CREDENTIAL_PROXY_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES of
	// each stream, bounds the decoded text to the same size (output that is
	// not UTF-8 would otherwise triple), holds about six times that per
	// request at peak (the two buffers, their decoded text, the JSON body and
	// its encoding; 48Mi measured against the 8 MiB cap, 37Mi for output that
	// is not UTF-8), and admits at most CREDENTIAL_PROXY_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMMANDS
	// requests at once, each holding its slot until its response is written --
	// 384Mi at the 8 MiB cap and the default of eight, which the cap test in
	// platformagent_manifests_test.go asserts against the 1Gi limit alongside
	// this request. The term that varies is the children: kubectl 1.35 listing
	// 4,000 pods measured 432Mi resident for -o json and 1,281Mi for -o yaml.
	// On a cgroup v2 node the kubelet arms the group OOM killer for the
	// container, so one such child past the limit takes Envoy and the broker
	// down with it -- a container restart, not one failed command. An install
	// whose clusters make that routine moves credentialProxyMaxConcurrentCommands
	// and the limit together; neither is a CR field today.
	//
	// Autopilot enforces a CPU:memory ratio between 1:1 and 1:6.5 GiB per vCPU
	// and raises the smaller request to meet it, so a 500m pod is admitted at
	// 512Mi whatever this line says. The request is declared at that floor
	// rather than left below it so the manifest the operator writes is the pod
	// the cluster admits on both Standard and Autopilot: the chart's footprint
	// file and its quota preflight sum this line, and a namespace quota sized
	// to a 256Mi footprint would pass the preflight and then refuse the pod on
	// Autopilot for the 256Mi the admission added.
