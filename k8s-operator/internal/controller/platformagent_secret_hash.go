// A ConfigMap edit rolls the gateway, because getConfigMapHash stamps the
// rendered content onto the pod template and a changed annotation is a changed
// template. Secret material had no equivalent. A container's environment is
// fixed for the life of the pod, and nothing recomputed anything when the
// Secret changed, so rotating a key left the running agent on the old one
// indefinitely, with no sign in the CR or the Deployment that it had happened
// (#971, finding 5).
//
// Four of the operator's pods read credentials that way, and three are
// stamped:
//
//   - the gateway, for the API_SERVER_KEY and SESSION_KV_API_KEY keys of
//     platform-agent-secrets. Its own API_SERVER_KEY env var is a non-secret
//     loopback sentinel; API_SERVER_EXTERNAL_KEY on the auth sidecar is the one
//     that carries the real key.
//   - the credential proxy, which is where the Slack and Teams tokens and the
//     model-provider keys are read (buildCredentialProxyEnv). It is a separate
//     Deployment, so stamping the gateway alone would have left the credentials
//     most likely to be rotated reaching nothing.
//   - under mode: next, the A2A gateway, for its bus password, the attribution
//     salt, its chat backend's token (Discord's, or the Slack pair, which a
//     Slack-armed install reads here instead of on the credential proxy) and a
//     door's bearer token. Stamped on its Secret refs generally rather than
//     for Slack alone: Discord's token was never covered either.
//
// The fourth, the mode-next A2A callout, reads NATS_PASSWORD, A2A_ISSUER_SEED
// and A2A_XKEY_SEED through SecretKeyRef and is not stamped: rotating one of
// those needs a rollout restart of the callout Deployment.
//
// This file is the missing half: a digest of exactly the Secret material a pod
// consumes as environment, stamped on its template so a rotation rolls it the
// way a ConfigMap edit already does.
//
// # Why a tick and not a watch
//
// The trigger is a bounded re-read on the reconcile tick, not an informer.
// Three places in platformagent_controller.go argue against watching Secrets —
// the grant withholds list/watch so a cached read cannot be added by accident,
// a cached Get of an unwatched type starts a cluster-wide Secret informer that
// holds every Secret in the cluster in memory and blocks WaitForCacheSync
// wherever the grant is trimmed, and enqueueing on Secret writes would wake
// every reconcile on every Secret write in the namespace. Beyond those,
// tests/test_operator_secrets_grant.py pins the verb set to exactly
// {get, create, update, patch, delete} and asserts separately that the operator
// can never enumerate Secrets; that test stands in for a Trivy KSV-0041
// exemption which cannot be scoped to one rule. A watch would have to delete
// it.
//
// Re-reading by name costs one Get per referenced Secret per reconcile and
// needs no verb the operator does not already hold. Where a watch on a trimmed
// grant hangs the single reconcile worker in WaitForCacheSync, an unreadable
// Secret here costs only the digest: stampSecretEnvHash carries the previous
// one forward and the reconcile continues, because everything below it in the
// pass — the Service, the NetworkPolicies, the status — must not be withheld
// over a credential this operator only wanted to hash (#964). What the tick
// buys is a bound rather than an instant: a rotation reaches the pod within
// secretEnvReprobeInterval.
//
// # What the digest covers, and what it does not
//
// Only Secret material that arrives as environment — SecretKeyRef, and
// envFrom.secretRef on a CR-supplied sidecar. Mounted Secrets are deliberately
// excluded: the kubelet refreshes a mounted Secret file in place, so hashing
// one would roll a pod over a change it was going to see anyway. The gateway
// has exactly one such mount, the SANDBOX_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY item of
// platform-agent-secrets (buildShellSandboxClientKeyVolumes), and rotating that
// key still needs a restart because an init container copies it to an emptyDir
// at pod start — unchanged by this file. The shell sandbox pod is not involved:
// it mounts its own <agent>-shell-authorized-keys and deliberately never names
// platform-agent-secrets. The A2A gateway has a second such mount: a
// Slack-armed gateway mounts the a2a-slack-principal-map Secret
// (a2aPrincipalMapVolumeSource), and the gateway reads that map once, at start
// (a2a/gateway/gateway.go, New), so an edit to it also needs a restart.
//
// Reading the refs off the rendered pod spec rather than naming
// platform-agent-secrets also covers the case where the CR supplies its own
// SecretKeyRef: that key lives in a different Secret, and anything keyed to the
// default name would silently miss it.
//
// # Why the digest is keyed
//
// The annotation sits on the pod template, which anyone who can read pods or
// Deployments can read. An unkeyed SHA-256 over the referenced values — the
// construction Helm's `checksum/secret` annotation uses — would let such a
// reader verify guesses offline: the pod spec names every Secret and key in the
// digest, and a CR-supplied SecretKeyRef can point at a value with far less
// entropy than a generated API key (code-scanning alert #37,
// go/weak-sensitive-data-hashing). So the digest is an HMAC-SHA256 whose key
// is built from the UID of each Secret the values are read from. A UID is 122 random bits
// minted by the API server, and reading it takes the same `get` on the Secret
// that reads the values — so a reader who can recover the key needs no digest
// to learn the values. The other places a UID can surface are Events and owner
// references that point at the Secret, and this operator emits no Events on
// Secrets and owns nothing under one; a third-party controller in the
// namespace that does would widen who can read the key, not what it protects.
// The key is stable for the life of the Secret, so an in-place edit, `kubectl
// apply`, or a patch keeps it and the digest moves only when a value does;
// deleting and recreating the Secret mints a new UID and rolls the pod once,
// which a recreate deserves anyway.
//
// Two keys that would have done less were rejected. The PlatformAgent's own UID
// is readable by the same audience as the annotation. A dedicated random
// Secret would need a create path outside `mode: next`, the only place the
// operator writes Secrets today, and one more object for a rotation to go wrong
// on. Hashing resourceVersion instead of the values was rejected too: a
// metadata-only write to the Secret bumps it and would roll the gateway for a
// change no container can see.
