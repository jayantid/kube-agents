// An entry in the identity map is a grant on a ServiceAccount, live from the
// moment the map is served. If nothing renders an a2a-bus token for that
// account, the grant is not documentation of a future client — it is a standing
// authorization waiting for one, in the file that is supposed to record who
// actually authenticates. This file had exactly that before A5: an `agent`
// principal keyed on the platform agent's ServiceAccount whose only bus client
// was the Hermes bridge sidecar, authenticating as static `worker` — so the
// entry authorized nobody and was withdrawn. It is back, and the answer is real
// now: buildPodTemplateSpec mounts a2aBusTokenVolumeSource into the
// platform-agent container, and the `a2a` CLI reads it (a2a/cmd/a2a/main.go,
// connect).
//
// So the set is pinned by name rather than by shape. Adding a principal here
// means saying, at review, which rendered workload presents its token.
//
// Two of the three answer inside this module: a2aBusTokenVolumeSource and
// a2aBusTokenVolumeMount have two callers each -- buildPodTemplateSpec for
// `agent` and buildA2AProvisionJob for `provision` -- so a renderer that
// stopped projecting either token would fail a render assertion here.
//
// `session` is the one that does not. The workload that mounts its token is
// the session pod, and the gateway's spawner builds that pod
// (a2a/gateway/spawn.go), not the operator, so no assertion in this package can
// reach it. What holds it is tests/conformance's C1, which reads the spawner
// and this package's RBAC together for exactly that reason. If the spawner ever
