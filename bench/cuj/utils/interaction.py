#: The hand-off Kage is told to send (agents/chat/SOUL.md §2, step 4) is one
#: lowercase line naming what it is checking:
#:
#:     checking checkout-gateway.
#:
#: The last branch matches that line only when it is the whole sentence,
#: starts lowercase, case-sensitively, and opens with one of the verbs the
#: template shows: a report sentence opens with a capital, so "Checking the
#: logs showed a crash." is kept as an answer, and so is a lowercase answer
#: such as "nothing is restarting." that merely starts with an -ing word.
#:
#: The other branches are the receipt that template replaced, still sent by an
#: install on an older image:
#:
#:     > 🔀 Delegated to the **<agent-name>** agent
#:
#:     I've started this as task `<task_id>`. The answer will post into this
#:     thread as soon as it's ready.
#:
#: Matching has to survive that formatting — the agent name arrives wrapped in
#: bold markers and the task id in backticks — and must not fire on a report
#: that merely cites its own task id. Each of those branches therefore pairs
#: hand-off phrasing with the thing handed off.
#:
#: Each receipt branch is the template's own wording, not a paraphrase of it: "Results
#: for the design will post below" and "Assigned under task t_...: start at
#: 14:00" are answers that a looser matcher stripped.
