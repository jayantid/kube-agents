#: The hand-off the front door is told to send (agents/chat/SOUL.md §2, step 4) is one
#: line naming what it is checking:
#:
#:     checking checkout-gateway.
#:
#: The template fixes the shape: one lowercase line, a hand-off verb, the
#: target, a period. A model capitalises a sentence's first letter out of
#: habit, so that one letter may be either case. ``_is_progress_ack`` strips
#: a line only when every word of it fits that shape and keeps it otherwise,
#: because a kept ack is text a reviewer reads in the transcript while a
#: stripped answer is gone. The verb comes from ``_ACK_VERBS`` ("Checking the
#: logs showed a crash." is an answer by its finite verb, not its capital); a
#: closing period or ellipsis is optional; the target runs to
#: ``_ACK_MAX_TARGET_WORDS`` words. Past the verb, a word belongs to the
#: target when it is:
#:
#: - a name: a word holding one of ``_ACK_NAME_CHARACTERS`` or wrapped in
#:   backticks ("checkout-gateway", "us-central1", "app=web");
#: - a function word from ``_ACK_OBJECT_LEADS``, or a determiner or pronoun
#:   from ``_ACK_OBJECTS`` straight after the verb or one of those ("looking
#:   at the logs.", "checking all the nodes.");
#: - a naming participle from ``_ACK_NAMING_PARTICIPLES`` and the one word it
#:   names ("checking pods labeled app=web.");
#: - an "-ed" word before a noun, after a determiner or preposition from
#:   ``_ACK_ADJECTIVE_CUES`` ("reviewing the failed rollout."), or straight
#:   after the verb when a plain word follows it and the word opens "un-" or
#:   the target runs on to a name or a preposition ("auditing unused node
#:   pools.", "reviewing failed rollouts in prod-a.", "checking pinned
#:   versions across the fleet."); a line ending on the noun reads as a verb
#:   and its object ("restarting cleared alerts.");
#: - any other plain word, in a run of at most ``_ACK_MAX_PLAIN_RUN`` of
#:   them, that is not a verdict or a verb from ``_ACK_FINDING_VERBS``; a
#:   plain word straight after a name counts only when one of
#:   ``_ACK_OBJECTS`` came before the name ("reviewing the checkout-gateway
#:   rollout." is a target; "upgrading prod-a blocks on quota." and "checking
#:   quota in us-central1 hit limits." are not);
#: - after a clause opener straight after the verb, anything ("checking why
#:   the rollout failed."), except an opener that is also a determiner:
#:   "checking that cluster found 3 stale nodes." is read word by word.
#:
#: Anything else keeps the line: a comma, semicolon, colon outside a link,
#: dash, question or exclamation mark ("checking the rollout, it's stuck."); a contraction of a
#: pronoun ("checking it's stuck."); a past tense elsewhere ("restarting
#: fixed checkout-gateway.", "restarting all failed.", "provisioning failed
#: when quota ran out."); a
#: determiner after a plain word ("restarting the pod cleared it."). Three
#: shapes have an ack's words and are stripped, pinned in
#: ``test_known_misreads_are_pinned``: a verb outside the lists inside a short
#: run of plain words ("scaling staging broke." reads as "auditing version
#: skew."), a past tense before a target that runs on ("restarting cleared
#: alerts in prod-a."), and a second clause after an opener ("checking
#: whether the rollout failed is done.").
#:
#: ``_DELEGATION_ACK`` is the receipt that template replaced, still sent by an
#: install on an older image:
#:
#:     > 🔀 Delegated to the **<agent-name>** agent
#:
#:     I've started this as task `<task_id>`. The answer will post into this
#:     thread as soon as it's ready.
#:
#: Matching has to survive that formatting — the agent name arrives wrapped in
#: bold markers and the task id in backticks — and must not fire on a report
#: that merely cites its own task id. Each of those branches therefore pairs
#: hand-off phrasing with the thing handed off.
#:
#: Each receipt branch is the template's own wording, not a paraphrase of it: "Results
#: for the design will post below" and "Assigned under task t_...: start at
#: 14:00" are answers that a looser matcher stripped.
