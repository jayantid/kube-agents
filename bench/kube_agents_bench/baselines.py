"""The checked-in baseline store, the version key, and computed admission.

WHAT A BASELINE IS FOR. Two of the four suite rules need to know how a case
behaves on ``main``: collapse (rung 4) may only red a case that has PROVED it
passes reliably, and the aggregate rule compares this pull request's pass rate
against main's. Neither question can be answered from the pull request's own
run, so the answers are screened once and checked in under
``bench/baselines/``.

THE STORE IS APPEND-ONLY JSONL, one ``<case-id>.jsonl`` per case, one screening
campaign per line. Nothing is ever rewritten: a re-screen appends a line and
the older lines stay, so the file is the case's history and not just its
current state. That matters for three reasons. Re-screening after a model bump
becomes a one-line diff a reviewer can actually read, instead of a rewritten
blob. The old numbers stay available to answer "did this case get less
reliable, or was it always like this" — which is the question that decides
whether a case is worth keeping. And an append conflicts with a concurrent
append far less often than two rewrites of the same object conflict, which is
what makes a checked-in store survive more than a handful of cases.

Only runs on ``main`` append. A pull request's own run is graded against the
store and never writes to it, so a case cannot move the baseline it is about
to be judged against.

EVIDENCE ACCUMULATES; IT IS NOT ONE CAMPAIGN. The admission bar wants twenty
runs and an ordinary run of the presubmit is three repetitions, so a rule that
read only the newest line could never admit anything the routine job produced
— the store would ship empty and stay empty. :meth:`BaselineStore.evidence_for`
therefore pools the NEWEST lines at the current key until it holds ``min_runs``
runs. One deliberate twenty-run screening campaign satisfies that in a single
line; seven ordinary nightlies on ``main`` satisfy it in seven. Pooling stops at
the bar rather than reading the whole file, which is what gives recency for
free: a case that starts failing has its old passing lines pushed out of the
window by the new failing ones, and de-admits itself without anyone editing
the store.

ADMISSION IS COMPUTED, NEVER DECLARED. A case is admitted because the store
holds screening evidence for it at the CURRENT version key, not because a task
file says so. Three consequences, all of them the point: a pull request author
cannot self-admit their own case in the same diff that makes it pass; bumping
any version de-admits everything until it is re-screened; and a key with no
record is reported STALE rather than silently compared against a baseline
measured on different software.

WHO DECIDES IS A MODE, AND THE ROSTER IS THE DEFAULT. ``EVAL_ADMISSION_MODE``
selects it (:func:`admission_mode`). In ``roster`` mode ``BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED``
decides admission outright and the record's verdict on the case -- would
admit, would demote, collecting, stale -- is reported beside it, never acted
on: nobody should be able to move a case into or out of the blocking set
without the eval crew knowing, and a roster edit reviewed in a pull request
is that knowledge (decided 2026-09-14, gke-labs/kube-agents#1493). In
``record`` mode the list is a fallback, not an override: it admits a named
case only while the store cannot judge it, and once a full window exists the
record decides either way. See :meth:`BaselineStore.admission`.

THE VERSION KEY, AND WHY IT IS MOSTLY NOT OURS. Three of its five components
are produced by devops-bench and read off the run: ``setupId`` from
``manifest.json`` folds together the agent model, the harness and the
augmentation, and ``scoringVersion`` from ``rows.json`` names the roll-up
formula. Those cannot go stale, because devops-bench changes them when the
thing they name changes. Only ``fleet`` and ``verifiers`` are hand-declared
integers in ``VERSIONS.json``.

Why hand-bumped integers and not content hashes: a hash over ``verifiers.py``
changes on a comment typo, which de-baselines the whole suite — and under a
checked-in store, re-baselining costs a pull request rather than an on-demand
backfill. It is the same contract ``bench/pyproject.toml`` already asks of
contributors for the devops-bench SHA. The trade-off, stated plainly: a
behaviour change with no bump silently compares against a stale baseline. A
lint for that is later work, not this module.

THE JUDGE MODEL IS PINNED INDEPENDENTLY of the agent model, which is why it is
a separate component rather than being folded into ``setupId``. A drifting
judge moves every baseline at once, and a judge that tracks whatever the agent
is running cannot be told apart from an agent that got better.

        reviewed diff, which is the point of the mode.

        RECORD MODE: the record governs once it holds a full window. When

        current key, that pooled rate decides, and it decides either way: a
        case at 12/20 is turned away even if ``bootstrap`` names it.
        ``bootstrap`` is then the fallback for a case the record cannot yet
        judge: no evidence at all, evidence only at a superseded key, or
        fewer than ``bar.min_runs`` runs at this one. While a named case
        rides that bridge the store's own state is appended to the reason --
