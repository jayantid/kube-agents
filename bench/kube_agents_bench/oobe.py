"""The ``oobe_audits_started`` check: did the first-run audits stage start every audit.

``agents/chat/scripts/oobe.py`` starts four Platform Agent audits once the onboarding
scan settles, by marking each due on that profile's roster. A started audit leaves a
row in the profile's ``cron/executions.db``. The case's stack
(``bench/tf/prebuilt/oobe-first-run-audits``) records when it armed the stage in its
state file, and the stage records when it marked each audit; this passes when every audit
has a run of its own claimed at or after its mark that got going: running, completed, or
ended after it started.

Its own module rather than a section of ``verifiers.py``, registered through the same
``devops_bench.verifiers`` entry-point group.
