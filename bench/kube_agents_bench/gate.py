"""``bench-gate``: the presubmit's verdict, moved out of the shell.

Three subcommands, one per side of the loop. ``bench-gate case`` grades one
task's repetitions and writes a JSON hand-off; ``bench-gate suite`` reads those
hand-offs and decides the job's exit status; ``bench-gate record`` turns the
same hand-offs into appended lines in the baseline store. The split exists
because the shell loop already knows how to run a task and diff the results
directory — those are genuinely shell concerns — while the ladder, the collapse
rule and the aggregate are not, and were previously four inline ``python3 -c``
heredocs that no test could reach.

THE LOOP CLOSES THROUGH ``record``. Everything the gate compares against comes
from lines that a run on ``main`` appended, so without a writer the store stays
empty and the two quality rungs never arm. ``record`` is that writer, and it
refuses to run where ``PULL_NUMBER`` is set: a pull request may read the
baseline it is judged against and may never move it.

EXIT CODES. ``case`` exits 0 whenever it produced a verdict, including a
blocking one: the loop must keep going so the summary covers every task, and
the blocking flag rides in the JSON. It exits 2 when it could not grade at all
(an unreadable task file, a bad flag). ``suite`` exits 0 green, 1 red, and 2
when the run could not be evaluated: an admitted case lost every repetition
to infrastructure, or every case did, so the run cannot certify green and
has no finding against the change either. That is the same code ``case``
uses for "could not grade", and for the same reason -- could not check is
not a pass -- and it is distinct from 1 so the shell, the artifact and the
dashboards can say "rerun when the environment is healthy" instead of
"debug the change". ``suite`` also exits 1 on what it cannot read -- a case
result the loop never wrote, a store that will not parse -- because those
are the job's failures, not the environment's, and must not read as weather.
``record`` exits 0 unless it was asked to write somewhere it cannot — it is
bookkeeping, and bookkeeping must never be the reason a merge to main reds.

ONE RUN, SEVERAL CALLS. Since the shell grades each case inside its fan-out,
the moment the case's last repetition finishes, ``record`` is called once per
case during the run and once more after it for whatever the fan-out left. The
``--recorded-manifest`` file is what keeps that idempotent: every append is
noted there as (case, version key), and a later call that names the same pair
skips it and says so, so a case recorded in a lane is never appended again by
the pass after the fan-out. ``--lines-out`` appends for the same reason. And a
run the Prow deadline ends before its suite step gets a table anyway: the
shell's EXIT trap runs ``suite --partial NOTE`` over the cases graded by then,
which banners the markdown and marks the JSON ``partial: true`` so nothing
downstream reads it as the run's verdict: hack/ci-eval-rc.sh's driver does
not let a partial JSON turn an exit 2 into NOT RUN.
