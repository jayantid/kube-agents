"""Read the onboarding stages' files off the shell sandbox and the agent pod.

The prioritization card's worker runs ``inventory_findings.py`` through its
terminal, and with the shell sandbox on that terminal is the sandbox pod: the
files it writes land on the sandbox's data volume, which the agent pod does
not mount. ``harness._agent_shell`` execs into the agent's Service, so it
cannot see them. :func:`sandbox_shell` execs into the sandbox pod instead,
named the way ``hack/ci-eval-pr.sh`` names it. The delivery job runs in the
agent pod and writes its marker there, which :func:`agent_shell` reads, along
with the scheduler's record of the job's runs.

A reply without a sentinel is a failed read, never an empty one: both shells
return ``""`` on any kubectl failure.
