"""Read the onboarding discovery sweep's fan-out off the agent's disk.

The sweep card is filed by the ``bootstrap-inventory-scan`` cron job, not by
the conversation a case drives, so nothing in the transcript names it. What
it did is on the agent's data volume: the card id in
``.bootstrap_scan_filed``, the cards its worker filed in the board's
``kanban_worker_children``, and the Cluster Agent roster under ``profiles/``.
This module reads all three in one ``kubectl exec``, the way
:mod:`kube_agents_bench.board` reads card statuses.

The roster is read from the profiles directly rather than through
``bootstrap_scan_gate``, so the read answers the same question on a build
whose gate does not list the roster at all.

A reply without the sentinel is a failed read, never an empty one: the
harness's ``_agent_shell`` returns ``""`` on any kubectl failure.
