"""Resolving a seeded-fleet fixture ROLE to the kubeconfig that reaches it.

A case addresses the standing fleet (``bench/tf/fleet/``) by the role a
fixture plays -- ``crashloop-workload``, ``idle-nodepool``, ``drift-outlier``
-- and never by cluster name or project id. Every eval project carries its own
set of seeded clusters, so a check naming ``seeded-a`` in project X is a check
that cannot run in project Y, and the pool of eval projects is meant to grow.

The mapping from role to cluster is NOT here. It lives in
``bench/tf/fleet/fixtures.json`` beside the Terraform that plants the fixtures,
and at run time ``hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh`` is the only thing that reads it:
for each role it writes ``<dir>/<role>.kubeconfig`` holding credentials for
whichever cluster of the leased project's fleet carries that role. This module's
whole job is the last hop -- role name to file path -- which keeps the
resolution single-sourced and makes this side testable without a cloud.

The one rule that matters: an unresolvable role RAISES. It never returns None
and it never returns the ambient kubeconfig. Silently falling back to the
ambient config is precisely the defect this module exists to remove (blocker
A5 in ``bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md``): the ambient config points at the agent's host
cluster, which has none of the seeded namespaces, so a safeguard reading it
answers a question nobody asked.
