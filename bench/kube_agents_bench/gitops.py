"""Wait for the GitOps fix cycle to land after the agent's turn.

Option C pilot (gke-labs/kube-agents#1307). In the GitOps cases the agent never
writes to the task cluster: it opens a pull request against a per-run branch
of the GitOps repository, a workflow in that repository merges the PR when it
passes, and Argo CD in the task cluster syncs the merge. The verifiers grade
the cluster, so the harness has to hold the run open until that sync has
happened, or until it is clear it never will.

Three phases, each bounded:

1. **PR**: a pull request whose base is the run branch, created after this run
   started, appears. None within ``GITOPS_PR_TIMEOUT`` seconds is the
   ``no_pr`` outcome. The lower bound on creation time matters: a rerun that
   reuses a cluster name reuses the run branch, and the previous run's merged
   PR is still listed against it.
2. **Merge**: the PR merges, or the repository's merge check (the check runs
   ``GITOPS_MERGE_CHECK`` names; other checks on the head are ignored)
   concludes failure, or it is closed unmerged. Failure or close is
   ``pr_rejected`` unless a later PR against the run branch exists, in which
   case the wait moves to that one and records the first as superseded;
   otherwise the cluster stays broken and the verifiers grade it that way,
   which is the point.
3. **Sync**: the Argo Application reports ``Synced`` at the run branch's
   current head and ``Healthy``. The head is re-read each poll because it can
   move after the merge (Argo tracks the branch, not the merge commit);
   ``head_moved_after_merge`` records when it did. Then the verifiers run
   against the recovered cluster: ``merged``.

The outcome and its evidence land in ``result.metadata["gitops"]`` and, because
devops-bench persists ``trajectory`` but not ``metadata``, in one harness-authored
trajectory entry named ``gitops_fix_cycle``. The pilot records the outcome and
does not score it (scoring it is Wave 1). A timeout in phase 2 or 3 is its own
outcome (``merge_timeout``, ``sync_timeout``) so a slow workflow is not misread
as a rejected PR.

A failed poll (GitHub 5xx, a rate limit, a kubectl error) is logged, counted on
the record, and retried until the phase's deadline; it never ends the wait on
its own, because merge windows are exactly when a hosted API is most likely to
hiccup for a moment.

Active only when ``GITOPS_RUN_BRANCH`` is set; every other case is untouched.

Env:
  GITOPS_RUN_BRANCH      per-run branch the PR must target (required to activate)
  GITOPS_REPO            https URL of the GitOps repository (required with GITOPS_RUN_BRANCH)
  GITOPS_ARGO_APP        Application name (default: the run branch's last path segment,
                         the task id in ``run/<cluster>/<task>``)
  GITOPS_ARGO_NAMESPACE  Application namespace (default ``argocd``)
  GITOPS_ARGO_CONTEXT    kube context of the task cluster (default: current)
  GITOPS_PR_TIMEOUT / GITOPS_MERGE_TIMEOUT / GITOPS_SYNC_TIMEOUT   seconds
  GITOPS_POLL_INTERVAL   seconds between polls (default 15)
  GITOPS_MERGE_CHECK     comma-separated check-run names whose failure means the
                         repository rejected the PR (default ``check``, the job the
                         pilot repositories' merge-on-green workflow runs)
  BENCH_GITHUB_TOKEN or GITHUB_TOKEN, else GITOPS_TOKEN_FILE   GitHub read token
