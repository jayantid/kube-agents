# devops-bench tasks through the GitOps fix cycle (Option C pilot,
# gke-labs/kube-agents#1307). One stack for every task on the cycle; the
# case's task.yaml picks the task through var.gitops_task.
#
# A devops-bench stack applies its manifests (and, for b-0011, mutates a
# Deployment in place afterwards). This stack seeds the same broken state a
# different way: the broken manifests live in a GitOps repository, this stack
# cuts a per-run branch from a pinned "broken base" commit, installs Argo CD on
# a fresh cluster, and points one Application at that branch. The cluster is
# broken because the repo says so. The agent is read-only on the cluster and
# fixes it by opening a pull request against the run branch; a workflow in the
# repo merges it when it passes, Argo syncs it, and the task's unchanged
# verification_spec grades the result.
#
# manifests/<task>/ is the HEALTHY baseline copied from that task's devops-bench
# stack. It is not applied at run time. scripts/render-broken-base.sh derives
# the repo's broken base from it, so the repo content and this stack cannot
# drift apart without a diff showing it. scripts/seed/<task>.sh holds the
# task's seeded-condition assertions.
#
# Lifecycle. The run branch is a null_resource with a create and a destroy
# provisioner, so it lives exactly as long as the task cluster: devops-bench's
# teardown (`tofu destroy`) removes both. Reruns are safe because create
# force-resets an existing run branch to the broken base. The default branch's
# content is never written, except that gitops_pin_agent_base_branch
# fast-forwards it onto the run branch's starting commit; the pilot-only
# default-branch mode (gitops_switch_default_branch) moves the default-branch
# pointer to the run branch for the run and back on destroy.
