# The scenario driver for bench/tasks/first-install-hello-running and
# first-install-hello-done.
#
# The first-install greeting fires once per deployment, on the first turn from
# a chat platform with durable delivery (the bootstrap_onboarding plugin in
# agents/chat/defaults/plugins/). The bench reaches the agent over the API
# server, which that plugin excludes, on an install that greeted long ago. So
# this stack writes the plugin's eval seam instead: a one-shot request file,
# named by the EVAL_GREET_MARKER prefix plus this case's suffix, in the chat
# profile's home inside the agent pod. The plugin injects the greeting for the
# request's variant on the first turn whose message contains its phrase, and
# unlinks the file. It binds no delivery and touches no onboarding marker, so
# the install's real onboarding state is the same before and after the case.
#
# One file per case, each with its own phrase, because the nightly runs cases
# concurrently against one install: a shared file would be overwritten by the
# other variant's apply, and a phrase-less one taken by any case's first turn.
#
# Destroy removes the file, in case the turn that should have taken it never
# arrived. Nothing else is planted, so nothing else is torn down.
