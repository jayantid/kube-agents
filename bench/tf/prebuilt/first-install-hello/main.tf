# The scenario driver for bench/tasks/first-install-hello-running and
# first-install-hello-done.
#
# The first-install greeting fires once per deployment, on the first turn from
# a chat platform with durable delivery (the bootstrap_onboarding plugin in
# agents/chat/defaults/plugins/). The bench reaches the agent over the API
# server, which that plugin excludes, on an install that greeted long ago. So
# this stack writes the plugin's eval seam instead: a request file, named by
# the EVAL_GREET_MARKER prefix plus this case's suffix, in the chat profile's
# home inside the agent pod. The plugin injects the greeting for the request's
# variant on every turn whose message contains its phrase, so a transport retry
# of the opening turn greets too. It binds no delivery and touches no onboarding
# marker, so the install's real onboarding state is the same before and after
# the case.
#
# One file per case, each with its own phrase, because the nightly runs cases
# concurrently against one install: a shared file would be overwritten by the
# other variant's apply, and a phrase-less one taken by any case's first turn.
#
# Destroy removes the file and reads back, failing when it is still there;
# until then it stays armed for its phrase. The request also carries the time
# it was written, and the plugin refuses one older than an hour, so a file a
# failed destroy leaves behind disarms on its own. Nothing else is planted, so
# nothing else is torn down.
