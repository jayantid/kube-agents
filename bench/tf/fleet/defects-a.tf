# single-replica workloads -- at replicas = 1 the audit produces no finding

# additionally asserts the container image and the absence of a
# rollout-restart annotation, so it is not only the replica count and the

# ceil(1 x 125/60) = 3 on the arithmetic, and 3/2/3 across the three eval
# projects when it was actually read on 2026-08-24. One replica is Ready and
# the surplus stays Pending forever, because an e2-small allocates ~940m
# CPU, system daemonsets take ~250m, and a second 400m replica does not fit
# a pool whose autoscaler is pinned at one node. That standing Pending
# surplus -- an HPA that wants more than the pool can ever place -- is the

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Defect (upgrades, API deprecation): a permanent caller of a deprecated API.
#
# Endpoints (core v1) is deprecated and still served (the fleet README says since
# when and for how long), so on every master this fleet will run, each write
# to it is audit-stamped `k8s.io/deprecated=true` -- and never
# `k8s.io/removed-release`, because core/v1 declares no removal. That is the
# whole yield: an Admin Activity audit trail a case can read by principal
# (system:serviceaccount:seeded-deprecation:legacy-endpoints-writer) plus
# methodName (io.k8s.core.v1.endpoints.patch). Never by the label alone:
# kube-system's endpoint-controller writes every Service's Endpoints and is
# stamped the same way. No GKE Recommender DEPRECATION_* insight follows and
# no auto-upgrade pause -- those exist for removed APIs only, and nothing
# after 1.32 removes a served API version, which is why the fleet plants no
# removed-API caller (README, accepted background).
#
# Mechanics: a CronJob (legacy-endpoints-writer) runs a short Python script
# every ten minutes on a dedicated ServiceAccount under a namespaced Role. The
# script reads /version first and refuses to write below 1.33 -- BROKEN, exit
# 1, before any write -- so the fixture cannot quietly degrade into an ordinary
# CronJob on an older master; otherwise it merge-patches an annotation onto
# the hand-written Endpoints legacy-endpoints-lane, which sits on a headless,
# selector-less Service so that the endpoints controller leaves it alone. The
# first run is a standalone Job the apply waits on, so the trail exists on
# apply day.
#
# Asserted by the deprecated-api-caller role in fixtures.json; no scenario
# reads it yet. The role asserts that no retained Job carries the Failed
# condition (backoffLimit 0 makes any failure the BROKEN exit) and deliberately
# not that a succeeded one is present: the first-run Job below has no TTL and
# stays Complete for the life of the cluster, so a succeeded assertion would
# never go red after the caller broke.

# The first run, so apply day already has an audit entry and the apply itself
# proves the writer can reach and patch its object: wait_for_completion fails
# the apply on a BROKEN exit. Same pod template as the CronJob's, but NO
# ttl_seconds_after_finished, deliberately: the provider's Read has no TTL
# handling and drops a Job it cannot find from state, so a TTL-expired
# first-run Job would be re-created on every reconcile -- and a re-created
# Job that failed would fail the apply. Without a TTL it stays, one Completed
# pod of a few MiB, and every later apply is a no-op here.
