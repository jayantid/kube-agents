# The seeded dirty fleet: three small standing clusters whose defects are the
# fixtures the Phase 2 presubmit scenarios assert on. Everything here is
# planted on purpose; "fixing" any of it breaks a test. README.md is the
# defect-to-scenario map, and the scheduled re-apply of this stack is what
# keeps the defects planted (GKE auto-upgrade would otherwise quietly heal
# seeded-b's version lag, and a well-meaning cleanup would delete the orphan
# disks).
#
# The label is deliberately NOT managed-by=kube-agents-bench: that label is
# what the eval orphan sweep in modules/cluster/gke deletes clusters by, and
# a standing fleet must never match it. kube-agents-host is the deploy
# pipeline's marker and is equally off limits.

  # SOP resolves a cluster's environment from `.resourceLabels.environment`
  # FIRST, before any name-keyword inference, and cohorts are keyed on

  # cohort, never merged. Labeling all three `environment = seeded` --
  # a literal the SOP's synonym table passes through unchanged -- makes the
  # drift cohort exactly {seeded-a, seeded-b, seeded-c} no matter what else
  # exists in the project: platform-agent-host and the transient eval-pr*
  # clusters carry no environment label, land in the unknown cohort, and
  # never vote on this fleet's baseline. Without this, a 2/2 authorized-
  # networks split against an unlabeled neighbour has no majority and the

  # "inferred environment" severity step, which the r = 2/3 math cannot

# rather than assumed: get/list only, no create/update/delete/patch on any
# Kubernetes object (its one *.create is container.tokenReviews.create, the
# read-shaped token validation API), and no container.secrets.* at all -- so
# this account cannot read a Secret on platform-agent-host either. It is
# project-scoped because IAM is where GKE authorization starts; the fleet
# stack's kubernetes provider only reaches seeded-a, so an RBAC-level grant
# could not cover b and c.
#
# hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh binds it by minting an access token
# (FLEET_READONLY_SA), which is why the token-creator grant below exists.
# Impersonation on `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` would NOT do:
# get-credentials writes an exec entry for gke-gcloud-auth-plugin, and that

# seeded-b is held one minor version behind whatever the REGULAR channel
# currently defaults to, derived live rather than hardcoded so the pin does
# not rot: each apply re-computes "current default minus one". The cluster
# is ENROLLED in REGULAR -- required, because the upgrade SOP's
# master-behind check compares a master's minor against its own channel's
# default, so a channel-less cluster falls out of the comparison and the
# lag is invisible. What stops enrollment from healing the lag between
# reconciles is the rolling NO_MINOR_UPGRADES maintenance exclusion on the
# seeded_b resource below, re-stamped each apply and capped by the API at
# the held minor's end of life.
#
# min_master_version is NOT a creation-time floor, and the pin depends on
# that: the field is not ForceNew and not ignored, and the provider's
# update path answers a raised value with an operator-initiated
# clusters.update carrying desiredMasterVersion -- "Only upgrade the master
# if the current version is lower than the desired version"
# (resource_container_cluster.go, the min_master_version branch). So the
# reconcile CARRIES THE MASTER FORWARD, which is exactly what keeps the pin
# from rotting: a new patch inside the held minor moves the master to it,
# and the day REGULAR's default rolls a minor, local.lagging_version
# recomputes and the next apply walks the master to the new
# default-minus-one. Both are manual upgrades in GKE's sense, and
# "manually-initiated upgrades begin immediately and ignore any maintenance
# windows" -- the exclusion never had to gate them, and does not.
#
# The provider only ever upgrades (cur < des) and a control plane cannot be
# downgraded, so the pin is one-way: if the master ever gets AHEAD of it --
# reconciles lapse past the exclusion window, or the minor reaches EOL and
# GKE auto-upgrades -- the lag is gone for good and the fix is replacing
# the cluster (`tofu apply -replace=google_container_cluster.seeded_b`).
# That replacement is not free: the drift SOP drops a cluster under 24h old
# from every cohort, which takes the comparable cohort from three to two,
# under its 3-cluster floor -- so the drift audit emits nothing for the
# WHOLE fleet for a day and consistency-drift-outlier goes red everywhere.
# Schedule it accordingly; the README's activation timeline has the detail.

# Defect (consistency): the outlier. A and B run master authorized networks

# normalizes to OFF -- absence on one cluster against an ON majority is the
# finding (SOP 4.5, base critical, the severity that survives a
# three-cluster cohort's two ladder steps). Two agree, one differs: the
# reason this fleet is three clusters and not two. Everything else on C
# deliberately matches its peers, so C is an outlier on exactly one facet
# and the split-cluster guard never mistakes it for an uncohorted cluster.

# change that recreates them (name, size, type, zone all force replacement)
# silently restarts that clock. creationTimestamp is server-set and
