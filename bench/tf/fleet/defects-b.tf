# The upgrade-readiness defects, on seeded-b because that is the upgrade
# cluster: it already carries the held-back control plane the readiness
# checks read, and a drain that cannot finish is the same subject. Each block
# names the CATALOGUE ROLE that addresses it — not a scenario, unlike
# defects-a.tf: no case reads these yet. Renaming a workload here breaks that
# role's probe and state assertions in fixtures.json, which surfaces as
# fixture drift on the hourly scan rather than as a red case.
#
# Upgrading a node means draining it, and most upgrade failures are really
# drain failures. What the fleet could already show was a workload that
# resists eviction (obtainability-audit's PDB checks, on seeded-a). What it
# could not show is what happens when the drain goes ahead: the pool has no
# room to add a replacement node, so an upgrade drains its only node in
# place, and the single replica pinned there is evicted and sits Pending
# until the node returns -- an outage, not a blocker. The disruption budget
# at the end of this file is the blocker: it refuses that eviction, so the
# drain cannot finish at all.

# Defect (upgrade readiness): a pool that upgrades in place. `max_surge = 0`
# with `max_unavailable = 1` means GKE takes the node away and recreates it in
# the same pool rather than adding a replacement first, so everything on it is
# down for the length of that recreate. On a one-node pool that is the whole
# pool at once.
#
# What this is NOT is a pool being retired, and the distinction matters for
# whoever writes the check. The node comes back, so a single-replica workload
# here suffers a guaranteed outage of minutes per upgrade, not a permanent
# Pending. It is also not universally a misconfiguration: the shipped
# gke-upgrades skill prescribes exactly `maxSurge=0, maxUnavailable=1` for
# reservation-bound pools and as the remedy for a stockout. So the finding a
# check should raise is the JOIN -- this surge setting under a workload that
# cannot absorb the gap -- and its tier is a Risk, not a Blocker. The Blocker
# on this cluster is the disruption budget further down, which stops the drain
# from finishing at all.
#
# A second pool rather than a setting on the default one, deliberately: the
# default pool's version pinning is what makes `version-laggard` exact (see
# main.tf), and a scenario that reds because this fixture disturbed the pin
# would point at the wrong place.
#
# `version` and `auto_upgrade` follow the default pool for the same reason
# the default pool carries them — a pool left to drift from the pinned master
# produces an undeclared `pool-skew` finding on a fleet whose premise is that
# every finding is known in advance.
#
# The price is one failed apply each time the pin moves: the update drains
# this pool's only node, the budget on pinned-batch-runner refuses the
# eviction, and GKE holds the drain for up to an hour before forcing it,
# past the provider's 30-minute update timeout. GKE completes the upgrade
# and the next apply is clean. A longer `timeouts` block would not help
# under the reconcile's one-hour per-project ceiling, and freezing the
# version is the pool-skew finding above.

# Defect (upgrade readiness): a single-replica workload pinned to the pool
# that upgrades in place. The nodeSelector names the one pool carrying the
# `seeded-role` label, so the pod does not fall back to the default pool while
# its node is being recreated — it is Pending for the whole recreate, and with
# one replica that is a full outage of this workload every time the pool
# upgrades. It is not Pending forever; the node returns. A check that reports
# "nowhere to land" here has overstated it, and an agent that reports minutes
# of downtime per node recreate is right.
#
# One replica, and that is a constraint rather than a preference. At two it
# would be a multi-replica workload with no PodDisruptionBudget, which is
# byte-for-byte the obtainability SOP 3.3 shape that `checkout-gateway`
# plants on slot a, and `obtainability-fleet-exposure-sweep`'s header rests
# on that workload being the fleet's only one: "the sweep has exactly one
# right answer". Its objectives are `report_contains`, so a reply naming both
# still passes — the cost lands on the case's premise and its judge rather
# than as a deterministic red. One replica avoids the question. SOP 3.3
# does not flag `replicas <= 1`, and a single pinned pod is still down for
# the whole of each recreate, so the fixture keeps its property and adds no
# finding. `inference-server` in defects-a.tf carries a PDB for the same
# reason.
#
# The hardening below closes the compliance and reliability findings this
# workload would otherwise add to a cluster whose accepted background
# findings are declared in README.md — the same block every planted workload
# in defects-a.tf carries. No topology spread: SOP 3.8 only flags
# multi-replica workloads, and one replica cannot spread.
#
# This is the pair to the fixture above and the reason both exist: a check
# that reports the surge setting alone is reporting a configuration, while a
# check that joins it to what runs there is reporting an outage. The two
# together are what let a case ask whether the agent made that join.

# Defect (upgrade readiness): an admission webhook that fails closed onto a

# repository's own operator webhook sets Fail
# (k8s-operator/config/webhook/manifests.yaml), as do cert-manager and GKE's
# managed-prometheus, so a check that fires on the policy alone reports every
# healthy cluster. Fail plus a backend that can never answer is the
# combination that turns a drain into a deadlock: while the backend is down,
# every write the rule matches is rejected rather than allowed through, and a
# drain that evicts the backend's own pod stalls on its own admission rule.
#
# `timeout_seconds = 30` is set explicitly, and the value is deliberate
# rather than incidental. "failurePolicy Fail with no timeoutSeconds" is
# not a plantable state: on admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 the API server
# defaults an omitted timeout to 10 seconds and the Terraform provider
# defaults its own attribute to 10, so the persisted object every reader sees
# carries a timeout either way and there is no absence for a check to find.
# 30 is the API's maximum, which is the dangerous end of the range and an
# observable property a readiness check can assert against.
#
# Two properties of the real finding are planted here and one is not. The
# dangerous variant matches cluster-wide, and planting that on a standing
# shared cluster would reject writes for every scenario that touches
# seeded-b, not only for this fixture — the fleet is read-only for
# evaluations, and a fixture that can break unrelated runs is not worth the
# fidelity. So the namespaceSelector confines it to the seeded-upgrade
# namespace, and the check is expected to flag `failurePolicy: Fail` onto a
# backend that cannot answer -- the unresolvable Service below -- and never
# Fail on its own; the scope dimension is left to a unit test with a
# recorded manifest, where nothing can be broken by it.
#
# `clientConfig` names a Service that does not exist, which is what makes the
