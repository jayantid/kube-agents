# 19: an in-tree gcePersistentDisk PersistentVolume, served through CSI migration, on a cluster whose PD CSI
# driver add-on is off. Run 1 found GKE enables the driver even when --addons omits it, so the driver is
# disabled explicitly; the running pod keeps its mount, and the break comes when the pool upgrade moves it.
# Run 19b's disable ended in a Compute Engine stockout (GCE_STOCKOUT) with the driver still on, and the run
# upgraded anyway; the disable is now retried and the run stops before the upgrade if the driver stays on.
