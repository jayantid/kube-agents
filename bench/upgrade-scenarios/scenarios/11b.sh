# 11b: the zonal control plane during its own upgrade, probed with a read AND a write. Each sample is up to three
# calls, a read, a ConfigMap create and its delete, each under a 3 s timeout, then a one-second sleep; the recorded
# gap between samples is two to four seconds (see the README's item 11).
# Run 11 polled only reads (/version), about every 2.6 s because each loop also asked gcloud for the
# operation, and saw no failure. This run keeps gcloud out of the probe loop and adds a write: a zonal
# control plane that serves reads from a cache but refuses changes is still an outage for a deploy.
