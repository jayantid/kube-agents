-- Quality-over-time dashboard over the eval baseline store.
--
-- The store is already the right shape for this: append-only, timestamped and
-- dimension-tagged, so there is no ETL job and no second copy. BigQuery reads
-- the same GCS objects `bench-gate` writes, and a new batch is queryable as
-- soon as it lands.
--
-- Run once to create the dataset, external table and views, substituting the
-- project and bucket. Everything below has been executed against a real bucket.
--
--   PROJECT=kube-agents-evals
--   BUCKET=kube-agents-evals-bench
--   bq --project_id=$PROJECT mk --dataset --location=us-central1 $PROJECT:eval_baselines
--   bq --project_id=$PROJECT mk --table \
--     --external_table_definition=./external-table.json \
--     $PROJECT:eval_baselines.evidence
--   bq --project_id=$PROJECT query --use_legacy_sql=false < ./dashboard.sql
--
-- The external table definition is a sibling file, `external-table.json`, and
-- it declares an EXPLICIT SCHEMA on purpose. Do not use `"autodetect": true`:
-- `blocked` and `infra` are omitted when zero and a judged metric is absent
-- when the run did not produce it, so autodetect infers the schema from
-- whatever happens to be in the sample and silently leaves out every field that
-- was not. A query for `blocked` then fails with "Unrecognized name" rather
-- than returning zero, and a metric added later is unqueryable until the table
-- is recreated. The record format's absent-never-zero rule is deliberate; the
-- schema has to be the thing that knows the full shape.

-- One flat row per batch, with the version key rendered as a single label.
-- Everything else selects from here.
