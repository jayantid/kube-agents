"""The gate's output with ``EVAL_BASELINE_STORE`` unset, pinned byte for byte.

``fixtures/golden/store-unset/`` was captured from ``main`` BEFORE the
record-governs-admission change, by running this same file with
``BENCH_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1`` against an empty store carrying the shipped
version pins -- which is exactly what the presubmit reads today from
``bench/baselines/``. The test replays the same three cases and two suites
and compares every artifact the shell would keep: the per-case JSON
hand-off, the suite markdown, the suite JSON, and what was printed. So a
change to admission, the aggregate or the verdict markdown can only alter
the store-unset presubmit by also altering these files in the same diff,
where a reviewer sees it.

The empty store is built in ``tmp_path`` rather than read from the live
``bench/baselines/`` on purpose: a ``VERSIONS.json`` bump, or an evidence
line landed there by hand, would otherwise fail this test and invite a
regeneration -- after which the golden would pin whatever HEAD does and the
"captured before the change" claim above would be false.

Two things are normalised, and nothing else: the absolute fixture path inside
``run_dir`` (the checkout moves; the record does not), and the additive
per-case keys -- ``admission_source``, ``admission_mode``, ``record_verdict``
-- which the store-unset presubmit never displays and which did not exist
when the golden was captured.

Regenerate with ``BENCH_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 uv run pytest tests/test_store_unset_golden.py``
and read the diff: it IS the behaviour change you are about to ship.
