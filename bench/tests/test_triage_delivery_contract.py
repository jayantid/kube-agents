"""The triage delivery contract, held together across the files that own it.

``_triage_task_body`` (agents/platform/scripts/session_kv_server.py) writes the
report template a Cluster Agent fills in. It permits two shapes, and the
difference between them is the whole subject of this module: with two or more
remediations the options are lettered ``Option A``, ``Option B``, ...; with
exactly one the template forbids the letter outright and labels that bullet
``Proposed fix`` instead. The call to action follows either way — the
single-option shape is those two bullets and nothing else — which is why
``To authorize:`` is the line both shapes carry.

``_drift_task_body``, in the same module, writes the card for an out-of-band
change to a live object and reaches the same contract by its own route: same
three ``##`` sections, same two shapes, same authorize bullet, different prose
around all of it. It is a second source of the same literals rather than a
caller of the first, so every join below is per template, and a case is pinned
to whichever template writes the card it grades. Pinning them all to one would
pass for as long as the two agreed on the phrase in question and stop asserting
anything on the day they did not — which is the day the join was supposed to
fire.

Two gates read the result, and neither is written in the same language as the
template:

* ``actionable_report`` (deploy/docker/patches/kanban_notifier.py) decides in
  production whether a completed card earns an ``incidents`` row — whether a
  reply saying ``apply`` will find a report to act on. Three regexes.
* The delivery objective of each case in ``CONTRACTS`` decides whether that
  eval case passes. Phrase lists in a task.yaml.

So one decision lives in three files, joined by string literals. **The
template↔notifier half of that join is already held**, by
``test_the_gate_recognises_the_shape_the_template_asks_the_agent_for`` in
agents/platform/scripts/test_triage_reply_roundtrip.py, which calls the real
``_triage_task_body`` and drives ``actionable_report`` on both shapes; it runs
on every pull request. For ``_drift_task_body`` there is no such test, so the
notifier assertions below are that template's only hold on the notifier rather
than a cross-check. The half nobody held is task.yaml↔template — a reword
there leaves the eval check asserting a string nothing writes, and a check no
report can satisfy reds the case rather than the reword, so the diagnosis lands
a long way from the edit. That is what this module is for.

The notifier assertions below are kept anyway, and they are the smaller half of
this file's value: the roundtrip test transcribes its exemplars by hand, while
these are cut from the template's own text, so a reword moves them with it. Read
them as the cross-check that the two gates have not diverged on the shapes the
template emits, not as first coverage of a join that had none.

Living in bench/tests/ rather than scripts/test_integration_contracts.py is
forced by ``verifiers``, which imports devops_bench — the bench environment is
the only one that has it. (pydantic, the other heavy import, is in the root test
environment already; Makefile PYTHON_TEST_IMPORTS names it.) Only the two tests
that instantiate ``ReportContainsVerifier`` actually need that; the phrase-join
test needs nothing beyond ``ast`` and ``yaml``, and is here to sit with them.

What is NOT asserted here is that the two gates are equivalent. They are not:
``actionable_report`` searches for the option or authorize bullet strictly after
the heading, requires that heading to be a real markdown heading, and is
case-sensitive on the option letter, while the eval check is a normalized
substring match that can do none of the three. The task.yaml comment enumerates
all three and says why each is an acceptable relaxation. The claim here is
narrower and is the one that matters — **on the shapes the template actually
produces, both gates say yes** — plus negatives, so a gate that accepts
everything fails here rather than passing quietly.

The template is read as TEXT rather than imported: ``session_kv_server`` pulls in
fastapi, ``agent_common_server`` and mcp, none of which the bench environment
installs. deploy/docker/patches/test_kanban_notifier.py reads
``verify_kanban_notifier.py`` the same way and for the same kind of reason. The
read goes through ``ast`` rather than a regex over the source, so f-string
quoting and escapes are Python's problem and not ours.
