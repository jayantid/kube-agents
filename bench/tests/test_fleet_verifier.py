"""Tests for addressing a seeded-fleet fixture by ROLE.

The load-bearing properties, in rough order of what they cost if wrong:

1. **A safeguard must be able to FAIL, not merely error.** A check that
   cannot tell "the agent destroyed the fixture" from "the cluster was
   unreachable" is worse than no check: the first is a catastrophic
   violation the gate must block on, the second is a coverage hole. The
   taxonomy tests below pin every branch of that split -- unreachable is
   ``error``, a missing namespace or object on a cluster that ANSWERED is
   ``fail``.
2. **An unresolvable role never falls back to the ambient kubeconfig.** That
   fallback IS activation blocker A5 (``bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md``): the ambient
   config points at ``platform-agent-host``, which carries none of the seeded
   namespaces, so a safeguard reading it answers a question nobody asked. It
   must be ``error``, loudly, naming the role.
3. **A pathless ``absent`` must not read as a clean pass on the wrong
   cluster.** ``kubectl get poddisruptionbudget -n seeded-reliability``
   against a cluster with no such namespace exits ZERO with an empty list.
   That is the one shape A5 broke SILENTLY, so the namespace preflight is
   what makes an empty list an observation rather than an accident.
4. **Nothing outside the catalog names a cluster or a project.** Every eval
   project carries its own set of seeded clusters, so a case naming
   ``seeded-a`` is a case that cannot run in the next project. The drift
   tests keep the task corpus, the catalog, and the Terraform agreeing.
5. **``fixture_role`` is required, and the ordinary path costs what upstream
   costs.** A ``fleet_resource_property`` that forgot its role would be a
   catastrophic safeguard reading ``platform-agent-host`` and passing forever
   -- A5 wearing the name of its fix -- so omitting it is a spec-load error.
   And classification only runs on an ABSENCE: when the comparison matched
   objects, the tests assert the namespace probe did not fire at all, because
   an earlier draft ran it unconditionally and tripled every check's kubectl
   count.
6. **Weather is retried; a missing kubeconfig is not; an observed fail is not
   erased.** Classification runs inside the ordinary poll loop, so one
   timed-out API call is not a permanent ``error``; role resolution sits
   outside it, because no amount of re-asking makes a file the runner never
   wrote appear; and a ``fail`` seen mid-loop outranks a trailing ``error``,
   because a cluster that goes away does not un-answer.
7. **The runner is shell, so it is tested as shell.** ``gcloud`` and
   ``kubectl`` are stubbed on ``PATH`` and the functions in
   ``hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh`` are sourced and called directly: label
   discovery, ambiguous slots, the read-only token rewrite, and the
   fixture-presence gate that is what entitles the verifier to call a missing
   namespace a destroyed fixture rather than an unplanted one.

    A pathless `absent` is a list, and the empty list it reads is grounded by
    the namespace preflight above. A path-scoped `absent` has no such grounding:
    the object is there, upstream resolves the JSONPath against it, and a path
    that resolves to nothing is exactly what the check is asking for -- so it
    passes. A MISSPELLED path also resolves to nothing. `spec.tmeplate...`
    returns `pass` with `path_matches: 0`, which means a typo turns a
    catastrophic safeguard permanently and silently green, and no run ever
    reports anything about it.

    Nothing in the Terraform can catch that, because the field is one no
    manifest declares -- `kubectl.kubernetes.io/restartedAt` is written by a
    kubectl verb, which is the reason the safeguard reads it. So pin each such
