"""Who admits a case once a store is configured, in each admission mode.

``fixtures/admission/`` is a local-backend store plus five synthetic task
files, one per state the store can be in. Every store line is at the
version key the captured ``agent-kanban-smoke`` records carry, so grading
those records against a fixture task reads the fixture store for admission
and nothing else. The lines are hand-written and say so in their task files;
they are the shapes seven ordinary nightlies at three repetitions produce,
not captures.

| case                | store                                     | on the list | record says  | record mode | roster mode |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| `record-admits`     | 21/21 at the current key                  | no          | would-admit  | record      | none        |
| `record-demotes`    | 12/21 at the current key (4 good, 3 bad)  | yes         | would-demote | record      | bootstrap   |
| `record-stale`      | 21/21, all at a superseded judge model    | yes         | stale        | bootstrap   | bootstrap   |
| `record-collecting` | 9/9 at the current key                    | yes         | collecting   | bootstrap   | bootstrap   |
| `no-record`         | nothing                                   | either      | none         | list or none| list or none|

Two rules, one per ``EVAL_ADMISSION_MODE``. ``roster`` (the default): the
list decides outright and the record's verdict is reported beside it.
``record``: the record governs once it holds a full window at the current
key, either way; the list is the fallback for a case the record cannot judge
yet. The first block of tests pins record mode; the second pins roster mode
and that it is the default. Everything runs through the CLI, the way
``hack/ci-eval-pr.sh`` drives it, with ``--baseline-store`` naming the
fixture directory so the verdict renders its evidence columns.
