"""Tests for the ``bench-gate`` CLI: the contract with ``hack/ci-eval-pr.sh``.

The shell can only see three things -- the exit code, the printed lines, and
the JSON hand-off -- so those are what this module pins. In particular:

1. **`case` exits 0 even on a blocking verdict.** The loop has to keep going
   so the summary covers every task; the blocking flag rides in the JSON and
   `suite` is what turns it into an exit code. A `case` that exited non-zero
   would abort the loop under `set -e` and silently drop the remaining tasks.
   It exits 2 only when it could not grade at all.
2. **`suite` exits 1 on red, 0 on green, and 2 on not evaluated** -- an
   admitted case that lost every repetition to infrastructure, or every case
   lost -- and reds on a case result the loop never wrote: unaccounted work
   is not a pass, and it is not weather either.
3. **The `Task <id> Result: [...]` line keeps its shape**, because people and
   scripts grep build logs for it.
4. **The environment carries every threshold**, since all of them are meant
   to be tuned against observed movement on main.
5. **`record` is the only writer, and only on main.** It refuses with
   `PULL_NUMBER` set, so a pull request cannot move the baseline it is judged
   against even if the shell guard is edited away. It also never reds: a merge
   to main must not fail over bookkeeping.
