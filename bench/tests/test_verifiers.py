"""Tests for the transcript stash and the three transcript verifiers.

The load-bearing properties, in rough order of what they cost if wrong:

1. An empty stash is ``status="error"`` — never pass, never fail — because
   that is what keeps ``VerificationCoverage`` honest when the harness never
   ran (the staleness caveat in ``transcript.py``). The same rule governs
   every input ``ledger_issue_contains`` needs and cannot get: no run clock,
   no credential, an unreachable API.
2. ``ledger_issue_contains`` must not pass on a PREVIOUS run's ledger. A
   stream owns one GitHub issue forever and rewrites it in place, so without
   the freshness binding the check would pass for good after one green run —
   the failure mode that would make the whole tier meaningless. It is tested
   from both sides, and the mutation check proves the thing can go red at all.
3. Wrapped in the upstream ``none`` compound, ``tool_called`` becomes the
   safeguard "this tool was never called", and an errored child must poison
   the group rather than read as "not called".
4. The entry-point registrations resolve through devops-bench's registry and
   its spec parser, exactly like a task.yaml would exercise them.

I've started this as task t_1d5250e4. The answer will post into this thread as
soon as it's ready.

Task `t_1d5250e4` is **done**. Here is the result from the `platform` agent:

The `checkout-gateway` workload is running in the **seeded-a** cluster. Both
pods are stable and have not crashlooped or restarted.

## Why
I checked the `seeded-reliability` namespace across the fleet. The
`checkout-gateway` deployment was only found in the `seeded-a` cluster.

* The two pods (`checkout-gateway-568bd768b4-4nt9s` and
  `checkout-gateway-568bd768b4-9pnnr`) are `Running` and have been up for
  `45h`.
* Both pods show a `Restart Count` of `0`.
* The `State` on the `gateway` containers confirms they started on
  Tue, 25 Aug 2026 and have remained running since.

## What to do
* **No action required** for `checkout-gateway` in `seeded-reliability` on
  `seeded-a`; the workload is healthy.
* If the user is observing restarts, they may be looking at a different
  namespace, cluster, or workload (such as the recent `payments-api` issue in
  `seeded-debug`).

I've started this as task `t_3a6c2c77`. The answer will post into this thread as soon as it's ready.

Task `t_3a6c2c77` has completed. Here is the full result from the **platform** agent:

## Control Plane Version Status

The `seeded-b` cluster's control plane is currently **up to date** with its configured release channel.

## Details

- **Current Control Plane Version:** `1.34.10-gke.1106000`
- **Configured Release Channel:** `REGULAR`
- **Channel Default Version:** `1.35.7-gke.1150000`

Although the current version (`1.34.10-gke.1106000`) is older than the channel's default version (`1.35.7-gke.1150000`), the cluster has a maintenance exclusion in place (`hold-the-minor-lag`) that blocks minor version upgrades until `2026-11-22`. Because of this exclusion, the current version is considered up to date based on the cluster's active configuration.

_WRONG_LAG_IS_EXPECTED = """> 🔀 Delegated to the **platform** agent

I've started this as task `t_f3a4de53`. The answer will post into this thread as soon as it's ready.

The task `t_f3a4de53` is now `done`.

Here is the complete result from the platform agent:

Cluster `seeded-b` is currently on control plane version `1.34.10-gke.1106000`, while its `REGULAR` release channel currently defaults to `1.35.7-gke.1150000`.

## Findings
- **Cluster**: seeded-b
- **Current control plane version**: `1.34.10-gke.1106000`
- **Release channel**: `REGULAR`
- **Channel default version**: `1.35.7-gke.1150000`

The cluster's control plane version is older than its configured release channel's default version. This difference is expected as the cluster has an active maintenance exclusion (`hold-the-minor-lag`) scoped to `NO_MINOR_UPGRADES` covering the window from `2026-08-24` through `2026-11-22`.

I've started this as task `t_3293aca1`. The answer will post into this thread as soon as it's ready.

The task has finished successfully. Here is the full result from the `platform` agent:

The `inference-server` workload is running in the **seeded-a** cluster, but its node pool cannot absorb additional load because it is hard-capped at 1 node.

## Why
- **Node pool max reached:** The workload is scheduled onto `pinned-inference-pool` via node selector `seeded-role: pinned-inference`. This node pool has cluster autoscaling enabled, but its `maxNodeCount` is currently set to `1`.
- **HPA is ready to scale:** The `inference-server` HPA is currently requesting `5` replicas (with a maximum limit of `10`), but 4 of those pods are stuck in `Pending` because the single `e2-small` node in the pool does not have enough CPU to schedule them.

## What to do
- Increase the `maxNodeCount` on the `pinned-inference-pool` node pool in cluster [seeded-a](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/clusters/details/us-central1-a/seeded-a?project=kube-agents-evals-6) to allow the cluster autoscaler to add more nodes.

    `render_issue_body` always appends `_render_check_evidence`, a
    {cluster, check, command} table built from `scope.clusters[].checks_run` --
    a field validation *requires* on every cluster. So every roster slug the
    run declared is in the ledger body whether or not the run filed a single
    finding, and `ledger_issue_contains` lowercases both sides and takes a bare
    substring. A phrase that is a substring of a slug therefore scores a run
    that swept the fleet and found nothing: partial credit for a clean sweep.

    This is not hypothetical and it is not a rule the task specs can be trusted
    to keep by eye. Four objectives shipped with it -- "pdb" inside `no-pdb`,
    "behind" inside `master-behind`, "cluster-admin" inside
    `cluster-admin-binding`, and "authorized-networks" which is a drift slug
    verbatim. Three of the four had a comment reasoning carefully about English
    substring collisions ("lag" inside "flag"), because they were written for
    the old `report_contains` surface, where the chat reply carried no table.
    The move to the ledger body invalidated the reasoning, not the phrases.

    The fix in each case was `scope: finding_ids`: ids come from
    `derive_finding_id` as "<check>.<cluster>.<namespace>.<object>", so a slug
    appears only if a finding was FILED under that check, and `_shorten_id`
    trims the longest segment and never the leading check slug. Hence the
