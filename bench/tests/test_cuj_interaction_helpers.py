"""Offline tests for the pure CUJ interaction helpers.

The live CUJ journeys stay manual, but ``substantive_output`` is a pure
function over one dict, and its judgment — what counts as a delegation
acknowledgment versus an answer — decides what every answer-scored criterion
sees. A regression here would misgrade live runs in ways indistinguishable
from agent behavior, so it gets the millisecond test the live suite cannot
give it.
