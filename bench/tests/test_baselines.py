"""Tests for the baseline store, the version key, and computed admission.

The load-bearing properties, in rough order of what they cost if wrong:

1. **Admission is computed from screening evidence, never declared.** It is
   the only thing standing between the collapse rule and a pull request author
   arming it against everyone else in the same diff that adds the case.
2. **A key with no record is STALE, not admitted and not silently compared.**
   A baseline measured on a different agent, judge, or verifier is not
   evidence about this run, and the expensive failure is not noticing.
3. **Three of the five components are read off the run**, so they cannot go
   stale: `setupId` and `scoringVersion` are devops-bench's own, and it
   changes them when the thing they name changes. The captured fixtures are
   what proves those fields exist and where.
4. **The store is append-only JSONL and nothing is ever rewritten.** A
   re-screen adds a line; the older lines stay and are the case's history.
   That is what keeps a checked-in store's churn tolerable and its conflicts
   rare, and it is what makes "was this case always this flaky?" an
   answerable question.
5. **Evidence accumulates, newest first, up to the bar.** An ordinary run is
   three repetitions and the bar is twenty runs, so a rule reading only the
   newest line could never admit anything the routine job produced. Pooling
   is what lets the store fill itself; stopping at the bar is what lets a
   case that has got worse push its own good history out of the window and
   de-admit itself.
