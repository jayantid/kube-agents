"""Shared fixtures for the scoring tests.

EVERY failure mode is a MUTATION OF A REAL RECORD, never a hand-written dict.
The six directories under ``fixtures/runs/`` are captured devops-bench output
(see their README for provenance and the one redacted field), and the helpers
here copy one and change
exactly the field under test. That discipline is not stylistic: the first draft
of the ladder gated rung 3 on ``metadata.session_id``, a key a devops-bench
record does not have, and hand-written fixtures would have agreed with it
happily. A mutation starts from the truth and can only drift one field at a
time.
