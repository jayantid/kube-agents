# ─── Install Configuration Input (install.env) ────────────────────────────────
# The hand-authored record of what this install is, loaded BEFORE the parameter
# block below so that every `${VAR:-}` seed in it inherits from the file. That
# ordering is the whole mechanism: inheriting prior configuration stops being
# something each flag has to remember to do and becomes the default path.
#
# An input the installer reads and does not rewrite. It creates one at the end
# of a first install, when there is nothing there, and never touches it again:
# a file the documentation tells you to edit and the next run overwrites is
# exactly the complaint against vars.sh, whose header said "auto-generated"
# while INSTALL.md told you to hand-edit it.
#
# `set -a` rather than a K=V parser: these values have to reach
# write_tfvars_from_state and the TF_VAR_* handoff at the end of it, both of
# which read the environment. A conventional dotenv without `export` would parse
# and then not travel.
#
# Always resolves to a path, whether or not a file is there yet -- a first
# install has nothing to read, and this is also where the file gets written.
#
# The directory is the CHECKOUT the run will end up in, which under
# `curl … | bash` is not the directory the operator is standing in. There
# ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} names no file, so a script-relative path resolves to the
# invocation directory; acquire_source_repo then clones to $HOME/kube-agents
# and cd's there, and every other front door resolves the file as
# ${repo_dir}/install.env (default_install_env_file). Freezing the invocation
# directory here would put the whole configuration -- API_SERVER_KEY and the
# plaintext model keys included -- where no later run looks: upgrade.sh would
# take its fail-closed branch, and a re-run of the one-liner would rebuild
# every PARAM_* from defaults.
#
# So resolve the same repo_dir acquire_source_repo will pick, by the same test
# and in the same order, before the parameter block reads any of it. This has
# to stay in step with acquire_source_repo; the shared marker file is the
# coupling, and test_install_script.py pins the pair.

🤖 kube-agents Zero-Friction Installer

Usage:
  ./install.sh [FLAGS]

Flags for AI Agents & Automation:
  -y, --yes, --non-interactive  Run in non-interactive mode (use flags/defaults)
  --generate-only               Generate install.env and terraform.tfvars, run
                                pre-apply checks, print lifecycle commands, and
                                exit without applying
  --dry-run                     Validate prerequisites & output config/plan without creating resources
  --gcp-project-id=ID           Target GCP Project ID
  --gcp-region=REGION           Target GCP Region (default: install.defaults.env
                                DEFAULT_REGION, currently us-central1)
  --gke-cluster-name=NAME       GKE Cluster Name (default: DEFAULT_CLUSTER_NAME,
                                currently platform-agent-host)
  --gke-cluster-mode=MODE       Shape of a cluster this run creates: autopilot | standard
                                (default: DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MODE, currently autopilot).
                                Autopilot clusters are regional. Passing this flag with
                                autopilot and a zonal --gcp-region is an error; leaving it
                                unset at a zonal --gcp-region builds Standard instead.
                                Ignored when installing onto a cluster that already
                                exists — its live shape wins.
  --agent-namespace=NAMESPACE   Kubernetes namespace the release installs into
                                (default: DEFAULT_NAMESPACE, currently kubeagents-system).
                                The chart wires the agent's model-gateway endpoint to this
                                namespace, so changing it is for CI and second installs

                                            model's context every turn, so it stops scaling
                                            once there is more than a few pages of it.

                                See 'make mirror-images'
  --allow-unverified-source     Provision from a dirty or mismatched checkout (local script edits

                                workspace the agent serves. The relay keys each one by
                                the team it authenticates as

                                GKE_METADATA. Recreates those nodes and restarts every workload on
                                them, kube-agents' or not. Without it a cluster with legacy pools is
                                refused unchanged (REFUSED_MISSING_NODE_POOL_MIGRATION); there is no
                                install without Workload Identity. The cluster's owner decides this.

                                enforcement on an existing GKE Standard cluster that has neither it
                                nor Dataplane V2. May recreate nodes and restart workloads. One of

Configuration file:
  install.env beside this script (override with KUBE_AGENTS_INSTALL_ENV) is
  loaded first, and a flag beats it. It is sourced with 'set -a', so a key it
  carries also beats an exported variable of the same name -- a flag is what
  overrides a recorded value for one run. Start from install.env.example.
  Anything it sets is inherited by later runs, so a re-run that omits a flag
  keeps the value rather than reverting it to the default above.

# A release-line checkout between stamps. A patch is stamped as a child of the

# descends from a stamped commit and carries its BAKED_RELEASE_VERSION, which is
# the previous release's. True when this is a Git checkout whose HEAD descends
# from the baked release's commit without being it: unreleased development on
# the line, whose images are built per commit, so the release's tag is not the
# tag to default to. Exactly the tag's commit is the release checkout, and a
# HEAD that is neither is left to verify_local_source_ref, which refuses the
# mismatch as before. A tag the checkout does not hold reads as "not past": the
# release's own commit is on the line's history, so a clone of the line brings
# the tag with it, and a checkout that lacks it is not one of these (the
# refusal that follows says to fetch the tags). And only when the script that
# is running is that checkout's own install.sh, carrying the same version: the
# baked version belongs to the running script, so a release's piped installer

# Create install.env from what this run resolved, but ONLY when there is no
# file there. An operator who hand-authored one owns it: rewriting it would
# discard their comments and their formatting, and re-introduce the exact
# complaint against vars.sh -- a file the documentation tells you to edit and
# the next run overwrites.
#
# Called after write_tfvars_from_state so the API_SERVER_KEY it records is the
# one the install settled on: recovered from a live Secret when there was one,
# freshly minted only when there was not.
#
# Derived values are left out by construction. PROJECT_NUMBER and KMS_LOCATION
# are recomputed wherever they are used, and the cluster shape written here is
# the one the interview asked for, never the probed TFVARS_CLUSTER_MODE, which
# write_tfvars_from_state re-derives on every run.

# What install.env records for a set of keys, and whether it records them at
# all, from one evaluation of the file.
#
# Asks bash rather than parsing the file, because bash is the other reader and
# the only one whose answer matters: bootstrap_install_env sources install.env
# at startup and load_install_env again on every front door, into the
# environment every guard here compares against. A reader that parses the line
# instead has to reimplement the grammar bash applies to it -- assignment
# prefixes and command words, redirections, `&>`, comments, quoting, backslash
# escapes, parameter and command substitution, a reassignment later on the same
# line -- and stay right about all of it.
#
# Sourced inside a function, because that is where both live readers source it,
# and the scope changes the answer. `declare -x K=true` is a global at the top
# level of a script and a local inside a function, so a top-level reader hands
# back `true` for a line whose value dies with bootstrap_install_env's return
# and never reaches write_tfvars_from_state. Matching the scope is what makes
# "what the file records" mean "what a run that does not already hold the key
# reads back from it" -- which is the question the guards ask, because the run
# they warn about is a later one from a shell nobody here can see. It is not
# "what this run read": see the `unset` paragraph below for the one class where
# those two come apart.
#
# Set-ness travels with the value, so no caller needs a presence test of its
# own. A `grep -E "^[[:space:]]*(export[[:space:]]+)?${key}="` beside this is
# the second parser the function exists to remove, and the two disagree on
# every spelling the pattern does not know -- `declare -x K=v`, `readonly K=v`,
# the second assignment on one `export` -- which is how a file recording
# exactly the flagged value earns "records no K".
#
# One evaluation for all of them, because the file is shell and a line may run
# a command: a key whose value is a command substitution fetching a secret is
# a network round-trip per evaluation, and the interview guard alone asks
# about twenty-three keys. Answers stay cached until the file changes. A
# caller reading through a command substitution primes the cache in a subshell
# that then exits, so the callers that read several keys prime here first, in
# their own shell, and their reads land warm.
#
# `unset` each key first, so a value coming back means the *file* assigned it.
# Without that the caller's own exported ENABLE_DRIFT_DETECTOR would read back
# as a recorded line, which is the one distinction the drift guard exists to
# make. The rest of the environment is inherited on purpose: a file recording
# `K=$OTHER` assigns whatever the real sourcing will assign, so the reader has
# to see the same shell the install runs in.
#
# That `unset` is the one place this reader and the live ones part company, and
# the class is `: ${K:=v}` and `K=${K:-v}`: the expansion fires here, where the
# key was just unset, and does not fire in an install whose shell exports the
# key already. The reader then reports `v` where this run read the export. It
# is still the right answer to the question the guards ask -- a later run from
# a shell without the export does get `v` -- but it is not what this run read,
# and a guard comparing the two announces a divergence this shell does not
# have. Kept rather than dropped: without the `unset` an exported key is
# indistinguishable from a recorded line, which is the defect this guard exists
# to catch, and answering both questions needs two evaluations and a caller
# that knows which it wants. Pinned by
# test_the_reader_and_the_install_diverge_on_a_default_assignment in
# tests/test_install_script.py, and the recorded-spellings list next to
# test_a_spelling_only_bash_sees_still_counts_as_recorded leaves `:=` out
# rather than certifying an agreement that is not there.
#
# A subshell of this shell, then, and not a `bash -c` child, which inherits
# only what is exported. install.defaults.env is sourced without `set -a`
# (see the block above `main`), so every `DEFAULT_*` is one of this shell's
# unexported variables and a child process cannot see any of them. A file
# spelled `ENABLE_GVISOR=$DEFAULT_ENABLE_GVISOR` -- admitted, because the file
# is shell -- then assigns `true` on the live path and empty in a child, and
# the interview guard reports drift on every interactive run against a file
# that agrees with the install.
#
# Executing the file is not a new exposure. The real shell sources it at
# startup and every front door sources it again; a throwaway subshell that
# reads keys back is strictly less than either.
#
# `%q` so a value carrying a newline still arrives as one line the caller can
# eval, and `>/dev/null 2>&1` keeps a chatty file out of the caller's output.

  #      answer lands in PARAM_MEMORY and in MEMORY_PROVIDER, and MEMORY itself

# A flag that beats install.env for a single run, against a file this installer
# will not rewrite. Says so, because the reversal is silent at both ends: the
# run that passes the flag looks like it took effect permanently, and the next
# run that omits it re-reads the file and quietly undoes the change.
#
# Only reachable on an existing install.env. A first install records both keys
# from the same PARAM_*, so there is nothing to warn about there.
#
# Fires on -y as well, unlike warn_unrecorded_interview_answers: that one skips
# non-interactive runs because their answers came from flags and the file, with
# no third source to surprise anyone. Here the flag IS the surprise, and headless
# is the route these flags were added for.
#
# Pass compare_as_bool=true for a key the rest of the pipeline reads through
# is_truthy, and both sides are then read the same way. Neither is canonical:
# install.env is hand-written and render_install_env.sh copies a GitHub variable
# in verbatim, so the recorded value can be True/yes/on/1 -- and the same PARAM_*
# is seeded from that value, so on a run that passes no flag the "flag value" is
# that spelling too. Comparing the two as strings reports a disagreement that
# does not exist, and the operator gets the destructive consequence line for a
# reversal that cannot happen: the next run re-reads True, is_truthy accepts it,
# and nothing changes. NAMESPACE is a string and keeps the literal comparison --
# `true` is a legal namespace name, and reading a recorded `yes` against a
# flagged `true` as agreement would drop a warning about a release moving.
#
# repeat_on names the routes that accept the flag: --agent-namespace is taken
# by install.sh, upgrade.sh and --menu; --enable-gke-backup-plan is install.sh-only.
#
# Pass empty_is_unrecorded=true for a key the generator resolves against a
# shipped default that is true. write_tfvars_from_state reads every boolean as
# ${KEY:-<default>}, so a bare `ENABLE_DRIFT_DETECTOR=` line provisions on the
# next run exactly as a silent file does -- while is_truthy below reads that
# same "" as off and returns before printing. The two readers would then
# disagree about what an empty value means, and the one shape the turning-off
# warning exists for is the shape it cannot see. Only a key whose default is
# true is affected, which is why this is opt-in: for a default-false key an
# empty line really does resolve to off, and the comparison is already right.
# The "records no KEY" wording the else branch prints is accurate for it --
# the line is there, the value is not, and "Set KEY=... in install.env" is

  # agent. Every provider here replaces it rather than supplementing it. Nothing
  # about memory keys off this flag, so an upgrade cannot read a false left in an
  # old install.env as "this install wanted no memory".
  #
  # `none` rather than an empty string: the choice has to survive the trip
  # through the CR, and an absent provider takes the CRD default. The operator
  # translates `none` back to Hermes' own spelling when it renders config.yaml.

  # `multiuser_memory` is the default provider everywhere it is named with no
  # install to ask (the CRD default, install.defaults.env, and both profiles'

  # store those installs already had before the searchable one existed.
