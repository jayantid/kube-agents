# ─── Install Configuration Input (install.env) ────────────────────────────────
# The hand-authored record of what this install is, loaded BEFORE the parameter
# block below so that every `${VAR:-}` seed in it inherits from the file. That
# ordering is the whole mechanism: inheriting prior configuration stops being
# something each flag has to remember to do and becomes the default path.
#
# An input the installer reads and does not rewrite. It creates one at the end
# of a first install, when there is nothing there, and never touches it again:
# a file the documentation tells you to edit and the next run overwrites is
# exactly the complaint against vars.sh, whose header said "auto-generated"
# while INSTALL.md told you to hand-edit it.
#
# `set -a` rather than a K=V parser: these values have to reach
# write_tfvars_from_state and the TF_VAR_* handoff at the end of it, both of
# which read the environment. A conventional dotenv without `export` would parse
# and then not travel.
#
# Always resolves to a path, whether or not a file is there yet -- a first
# install has nothing to read, and this is also where the file gets written.
#
# The directory is the CHECKOUT the run will end up in, which under
# `curl … | bash` is not the directory the operator is standing in. There
# ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} names no file, so a script-relative path resolves to the
# invocation directory; acquire_source_repo then clones to $HOME/kube-agents
# and cd's there, and every other front door resolves the file as
# ${repo_dir}/install.env (default_install_env_file). Freezing the invocation
# directory here would put the whole configuration -- API_SERVER_KEY and the
# plaintext model keys included -- where no later run looks: upgrade.sh would
# take its fail-closed branch, and a re-run of the one-liner would rebuild
# every PARAM_* from defaults.
#
# So resolve the same repo_dir acquire_source_repo will pick, by the same test
# and in the same order, before the parameter block reads any of it. This has
# to stay in step with acquire_source_repo; the shared marker file is the
# coupling, and test_install_script.py pins the pair.

Configuration file:
  install.env beside this script (override with KUBE_AGENTS_INSTALL_ENV) is
  loaded first, and a flag beats it. It is sourced with 'set -a', so a key it
  carries also beats an exported variable of the same name -- a flag is what
  overrides a recorded value for one run. Start from install.env.example.
  Anything it sets is inherited by later runs, so a re-run that omits a flag
  keeps the value rather than reverting it to the default above.

#
# Called after write_tfvars_from_state so the API_SERVER_KEY it records is the
# one the install settled on: recovered from a live Secret when there was one,
# freshly minted only when there was not.
#
# Derived values are left out by construction. PROJECT_NUMBER and KMS_LOCATION
# are recomputed wherever they are used, and the cluster shape written here is
# the one the interview asked for, never the probed TFVARS_CLUSTER_MODE, which
# write_tfvars_from_state re-derives on every run.
# The value install.env records for one key, empty when it records none.
# Reads the file rather than the environment: install.env was sourced at
# startup into these very names, and the interview has since overwritten them,
# so the environment no longer remembers what the file said.
#
# Always returns 0. A `return 1` for "no such key" would be the natural
# signature and is the wrong one here: this is called from a command
# substitution, `set -E` propagates the ERR trap into that subshell, and the
# trap fires on the non-zero return before the caller's `||` is ever consulted
# -- printing an abort banner per absent key. Callers test presence separately.
#
# The value is unquoted the way sourcing the file would unquote it, because
# both things that write install.env quote it. write_env_var here and
# save_env_var in scripts/installer/installer_common.sh both serialise with
# `printf '%s=%q\n'`, and %q renders the empty string as the two-character
# literal '' and escapes anything the shell would treat specially -- so
# `#gke-alerts` is written `\#gke-alerts`. Comparing a quoted recorded value
# against an unquoted environment one reports every empty key as drifted, and
# the line the banner prints for each (`KEY=`) changes nothing, so the next run
# reports them again. That buries the
# one case the warning exists for.
#
# A hand-authored file is the other half of the same problem and the reason
# this cannot simply re-quote the current value and compare the quoted forms:
# an operator writes `SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL="#gke-alerts"`, which %q would render

  #
  #   1. The setting must have an interview question. ENABLE_GKE_BACKUP_PLAN and

  #      precisely because nothing asks about them, so they cannot drift and
  #      listing them here would only ever compare a value against itself.
  #   2. The answer must be readable under the key's own name. Most of the
  #      interview re-exports into exactly that name, but MEMORY does not: its
  #      answer lands in PARAM_MEMORY and in MEMORY_PROVIDER, and MEMORY itself
  #      still holds whatever install.env set at startup. Comparing `$MEMORY`
  #      would therefore always find them equal and never report the one case
  #      that matters most -- switching to Hindsight, getting it provisioned,
  #      and having the next run derive multiuser_memory from the unchanged file
  #      and tear the Hindsight API and its Postgres back down.
