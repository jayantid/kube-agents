Exit codes:
  0  Teardown completed (or --dry-run finished, or you declined the
     confirmation).
  3  Nothing to tear down: no Terraform state for this cluster in GCS or
     locally. Either nothing is installed here, or the install predates the
     Terraform engine — see --source-ref. Not a failure.
  1  Anything else — the teardown could not start, or started and did not
     finish.

  --source-ref hands over to the pinned release's own uninstall.sh wholesale,
  so from then on the exit code is that release's, not this contract.
