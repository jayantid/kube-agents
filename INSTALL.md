## Method 0: Zero-Friction One-Liner Installation (Fastest)

Run the interactive one-liner installer directly in **Google Cloud Shell** or any authenticated bash terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh | bash
```

_Substitute `<RELEASE_VERSION>` with the desired release tag from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/releases) (for example, `0.4.0`)._

When running the official release installer (`<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh`) or executing inside an official release checkout or unpacked release archive, the release version is baked in and used automatically without prompting. A checkout of a release line (`release/<X.Y>`) that has moved past its latest release still carries that release's baked version but is not that release: run from that checkout, with the release's tag and full history fetched, `install.sh` defaults to the checkout's own commit, as a `main` checkout does, and says so; a clone that lacks the tag, or whose shallow history stops short of the release, is refused and told which fetch to run.

### What `install.sh` Automatically Handles:

- **`gcloud` Authentication**: Checks login state and launches auth flows if needed.
- **GCP Project & Region Selection**: Auto-detects the active project and prompts for confirmation; you can type a project ID that the discovered list does not show.
- **Install Sources**: Puts the Terraform configuration and chart on disk (this checkout, or a clone at the requested revision) and verifies they match the image ref _before_ the interview starts. A clone an earlier one-liner left at `$HOME/kube-agents` is moved to the requested release when it is clean (detached at the tag; a branch it was on stays where it was, and untracked files such as `install.env` are kept), and left alone when it has uncommitted changes, where verification then stops the run.
- **GKE Cluster Setup**: Provisions an Autopilot or Standard cluster (`--gke-cluster-mode`, Autopilot by default) or connects to an existing one. Autopilot is regional, so a zonal `--gcp-region` with no explicit `--gke-cluster-mode` builds Standard instead of failing; asking for `--gke-cluster-mode=autopilot` at a zone is still an error.
- **Chat Integrations**: Configures Google Chat and/or Slack when selected.
- **AI Model Credentials**: Prompts for Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic credentials, or selects Vertex AI (no key — Workload Identity).
- **Long-Term Memory**: Asks whether the agents should remember anything between conversations, and if so which store (`--memory=file|hindsight|off`, default `file`). The default is **on**, and it is the store this repository shipped before the searchable one existed, so an upgrade that says nothing about memory keeps what it already has: per-user Markdown inside the pod (`multiuser_memory`), no extra services, suited to **small or personal** deployments — but the whole store is loaded into the model's context every turn, so it stops scaling past a few pages. Pick `hindsight` for **enterprise** deployments — ranked recall that stays affordable as the store grows, at the cost of an API server and a Postgres database in the cluster; it selects the `kube_agents_memory` provider. Pick `off` to retain nothing and run no database. The measurements behind that split, and how to change it later, are in [`docs/designs/memory.md`](docs/designs/memory.md).
- **Automated Engine Execution**: Generates `terraform/examples/full-install/terraform.tfvars` from the loaded configuration, records that configuration in `install.env` when a first install has none, and launches `lifecycle.sh apply` — a single `terraform apply` that provisions every GCP resource and installs the Helm chart, with the Terraform state kept in a versioned GCS bucket (`<project>-kube-agents-tfstate`).

The installer's engine is [Method 1](#method-1-the-install-engine--terraform--helm): the
[`terraform/examples/full-install`](terraform/examples/full-install/README.md) composition, which is
the canonical description of what gets created. When adopting a **pre-existing** cluster, four mutations
are checked out-of-band by `install.sh` before the apply: CMEK database encryption (a control-plane
update), Workload Identity pool enablement, node-pool migration to `GKE_METADATA` (recreates nodes;
requires `--migrate-node-pools` or `MIGRATE_NODE_POOLS=true`), and NetworkPolicy enforcement, where
the cluster's owner chooses between enabling the legacy Calico addon (`--enable-network-policy` or
`ENABLE_NETWORK_POLICY=true`; may recreate nodes) and installing without enforcement
(`--accept-no-network-policy` or `ACCEPT_NO_NETWORK_POLICY=true`; the cluster is left as it is and the
choice is recorded); see the site's
[cluster requirements](docs/site/src/content/docs/install/prerequisites.md#cluster-requirements).
On Standard clusters, Terraform also adds a `gvisor-pool` node pool unless `--enable-gvisor=false`.
Outside cluster adoption, two tasks stay outside Terraform: setting the managed-OTel collection scope
on freshly created clusters (no Terraform field exists) and the GitHub App private-key import into KMS
(the PEM must not enter Terraform state). The installer sources
`scripts/installer/installer_common.sh`, which reads `install.defaults.env`, so its defaults
(region, cluster name, model provider, registry prefix) and its accepted values live in exactly
one place; see
[Shared defaults live in `installer_common.sh`](scripts/installer/README.md#shared-defaults-live-in-installer_commonsh).

Three behaviours worth knowing before the first run:

- **The image/source ref defaults to the release version (in release checkouts and bundles) or the checkout's `HEAD` commit SHA (on `main`)**, and must be a SemVer release tag or a full 40-character commit SHA. Provisioning refuses to start from a dirty or mismatched checkout so the scripts and the container image stay on one revision; pass `--allow-unverified-source` to override that while iterating on the installer itself. Do not install from a `main` checkout when targeting an official release: manifests and CRD schemas on `main` diverge from older releases, and `verify_local_source_ref` blocks mismatched revisions to prevent broken installations.
- **The agent's GCP IAM permission set defaults to `read-only`**, matching the provisioner. It
  controls cloud-plane writes only — Kubernetes RBAC is read-only in every set, and the GitOps
  pull-request path works in every set. See the site's
  [security and IAM reference](docs/site/src/content/docs/reference/security-and-iam.md).
- **The agent runs sandboxed under gVisor**, because it executes model-authored commands and an
  unsandboxed pod shares the node kernel with everything else on the node. Autopilot, the shape a
  fresh install creates, ships the RuntimeClass and needs no node pool, from GKE `1.27.4-gke.800`
  on — so the sandbox costs nothing there. On a Standard cluster it provisions a `gvisor-pool`
  node pool of one `e2-standard-4` per zone. Pass `--enable-gvisor=false` to run on the standard
  container runtime.

### Generate-Only Mode (Recommended for Existing Infrastructure)

When deploying `kube-agents` onto **pre-existing infrastructure** (an existing GKE cluster, shared VPC, or existing GCP project), running with `--generate-only` (or answering `g` at the installer's final confirmation prompt) is the **recommended approach**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh | bash -s -- \
  --generate-only \
  --gcp-project-id="my-gcp-project" \
  --gke-cluster-name="existing-cluster-name" \
  --gcp-region="us-central1"
```

#### Why `--generate-only` on Existing Infrastructure:

- **Operator Review Before Live Mutation**: Adopting existing infrastructure means `terraform apply` touches resources you did not create, so generating the inputs (`terraform.tfvars`, `install.env`) and reviewing them before the apply keeps that decision with the operator.
- **Out-of-Terraform Prerequisites & Operator Handoff**: The installer probes the target cluster, runs pre-apply validations without mutating GCP resources, and prints a checklist of the steps Terraform cannot perform (CMEK database encryption, the Workload Identity pool, NetworkPolicy enforcement, the GitHub App private key import, and the managed-OTel scope) for you to apply as they pertain to your cluster.

#### What `--generate-only` Does:

1. Probes cluster parameters and writes the complete configuration to `install.env` (if absent) and `terraform/examples/full-install/terraform.tfvars`.
2. Runs the same pre-flight checks a real run does — including the existing-cluster node-pool and NetworkPolicy consent gates, and the refusal for a cluster that cannot be described — without creating or modifying GCP resources. A cluster that needs `--migrate-node-pools`, or one that enforces no NetworkPolicy and was given neither `--enable-network-policy` nor `--accept-no-network-policy`, is refused here, exiting 1 with a `REFUSED_*` status. `install.env` and `terraform.tfvars` are written before these checks run, so a refused run leaves both on disk; what it withholds is the operator handoff and the `GENERATE_ONLY_SUCCESS` report, and the tfvars it leaves behind have not been validated.
3. Prints the exact step-by-step manual execution recipe:
   - **Out-of-Terraform prerequisites** for existing clusters (CMEK database encryption enablement, node-pool `GKE_METADATA` workload identity update, NetworkPolicy enablement, and Cloud KMS key creation for GitHub App private key signing).
   - **Terraform Apply execution** with remote state management via `lifecycle.sh`:
     ```bash
     cd terraform/examples/full-install
     KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_BUCKET="<project>-kube-agents-tfstate" KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_PREFIX="kube-agents/<cluster>" ./lifecycle.sh apply
     ```
   - **Post-apply steps** (managed-OTel collection scope, on a cluster this install created).
4. Exits with code `0` and writes `{"status": "GENERATE_ONLY_SUCCESS", ...}` to `/tmp/kube-agents-install-report.json`.

### Non-Interactive & AI Agent Execution Mode

For human operators, running the official release installer interactively (Method 0 above, or `./install.sh` inside an official release checkout or bundle) is strongly recommended on initial setup: it detects sensible defaults from your active `gcloud` session, prompts for mandatory cloud project and LLM provider credentials, and records configuration to `install.env`.

For headless environments, automated CI scripts, and AI Agent harnesses where no interactive TTY is available, execute the release-pinned installer non-interactively by supplying explicit CLI flags:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh | bash -s -- \
  --non-interactive \
  --gcp-project-id="my-gcp-project" \
  --gke-cluster-name="platform-agent-host" \
  --gcp-region="us-central1" \
  --model-provider="gemini" \
  --permission-set="read-only"
```

When enabling GitOps pull-request automation, also provide the GitOps repository and GitHub App parameters:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh | bash -s -- \
  --non-interactive \
  --gcp-project-id="YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID" \
  --gke-cluster-name="platform-agent-host" \
  --gcp-region="us-central1" \
  --model-provider="gemini" \
  --permission-set="read-only" \
  --gitops-org="YOUR_GITHUB_ORG" \
  --gitops-repo="YOUR_GITOPS_REPO" \
  --github-app-id="YOUR_GITHUB_APP_ID" \
  --github-pem-path="/path/to/app-private-key.pem"
```

_(If the Cloud KMS key was already imported Ahead-Of-Time, `--github-pem-path` can be omitted; see [Token Minter Guide](docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/token-minter.md).)_

To run pre-flight checks and output configuration state (`terraform.tfvars` and
`/tmp/kube-agents-install-report.json`) without creating cloud resources — the dry run also
validates the Terraform configuration, and previews the full resource plan when Application
Default Credentials are available:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh | bash -s -- \
  --dry-run \
  --non-interactive \
  --gcp-project-id="my-gcp-project"
```

_Guidance for AI Agents:_ For production deployments, deploy or test from an official release using the release installer (`<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh`), the published release tarball (`kube-agents-<RELEASE_VERSION>.tar.gz` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/releases), e.g. `0.4.0`), or `git clone --branch <RELEASE_VERSION>` if a Git checkout is specifically needed. Do not deploy from a `main` checkout: manifests and CRD schemas on `main` diverge from released versions, and `verify_local_source_ref` blocks mismatched revisions.

#### AI-Assisted Installation

To hand the install to an AI coding assistant, give it this prompt. It needs no checkout of this
repository:

```text
Install the latest official release of kube-agents (github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents) into my GCP project.
Follow INSTALL.md from that release tag — do not invent installer URLs, namespaces, or model names.
First inspect my gcloud project and existing GKE clusters and confirm the target, cluster, model provider,
and credential with me. Run install.sh with --dry-run and show me its printed summary before you change anything.
Only run the real install after I say yes.
```

An assistant working in a checkout of this repository also picks up the
[`install-kube-agents`](.agents/skills/install-kube-agents/SKILL.md) skill from `.agents/skills/`
(`.claude/skills/` links to it), which covers the same install; the steps below apply either way.

An agent given that prompt, or reading this file on its own, follows these steps:

1. Resolve the latest stable release tag from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/releases) and substitute it for
   `<RELEASE_VERSION>` below.
2. Read the operator's environment and confirm the target with them before going further —
   project, cluster, its location (the zone, not the region, for a zonal cluster, exactly as
   `clusters list` shows it), model provider (`gemini`, `vertex_ai`, `anthropic` or `openai`), and
   where the model credential comes from:

   ```bash
   gcloud config get-value project
   gcloud container clusters list --project="YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID"
   ```

3. Run the dry run with the confirmed values from a directory that is not a kube-agents checkout
   and holds no `install.env`; the installer would load one found there in place of
   `$HOME/kube-agents/install.env`. Run from a checkout, the installer uses that checkout's
   sources, and a real run refuses one that
   is not at `<RELEASE_VERSION>`; do not pass `--allow-unverified-source` to get past that. Run from
   elsewhere, it clones to, or reuses, `$HOME/kube-agents` (see Install Sources under
   [Method 0](#method-0-zero-friction-one-liner-installation-fastest)), and a real run refuses a
   clone there with uncommitted changes. A dry run regenerates `terraform.tfvars` in that clone, so
   back it up first if it belongs to a live deployment. If `$HOME/kube-agents/install.env` exists,
   it records an earlier install, and the installer loads it before any flag: its chat, Slack,
   GitOps, memory and key settings carry into this one, and the pre-flight summary does not show
   all of them. Ask the operator whether this install is that same deployment. If it is not, have
   them move the file aside (for example to `install.env.<old-cluster>`) before the dry run, so the
   new install records its own; the moved file still serves the old deployment through
   `KUBE_AGENTS_INSTALL_ENV`. For `gemini`, `openai` or `anthropic`, have
   the operator export `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the shell before
   starting, so the key stays out of the command line and the agent's transcript; `vertex_ai` needs
   no key, and `gemini` can instead read one from the Secret Manager secret
   `DEFAULT_GEMINI_API_KEY_SECRET_NAME` names in `install.defaults.env`. Without a key, the
   installer only warns, and the agent it installs cannot call a model.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh | bash -s -- \
     --dry-run \
     --non-interactive \
     --gcp-project-id="YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID" \
     --gke-cluster-name="YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME" \
     --gcp-region="YOUR_CLUSTER_LOCATION" \
     --model-provider="YOUR_MODEL_PROVIDER"
   ```

   Show the operator the dry run's printed summary and warnings, not only the `status` in
   `/tmp/kube-agents-install-report.json`: the report says `DRY_RUN_SUCCESS` even when a real run
   will be refused. On an existing cluster, the summary's `Existing Cluster Mutations (Adoption)`
   block lists every change the install makes to it, and marks `Refused` each one that needs a
   consent flag.

4. On an existing cluster, add the flag each `Refused` line names (`--migrate-node-pools`,
   `--enable-network-policy` or `--accept-no-network-policy`) once the operator has agreed to it,
   and dry-run again until none remain. The same block lists changes that need no flag but cannot
   be reverted or add cost, such as enabling Workload Identity or CMEK, or creating the gVisor node
   pool; name each one to the operator too. Only after the operator approves, run the same command
   without `--dry-run`. A real run that still ends in a `REFUSED_*` status is a new question for
   the operator, not something to work around.

A flag left out does not always take the shipped default. A flag wins over an `install.env` from an
earlier run, which wins over an exported variable — including an exported API key — which wins over
`install.defaults.env`; see
[`scripts/installer/README.md`](scripts/installer/README.md#the-install-configuration-installenv).

## Architecture & Overview

The Kubernetes Agentic Harness manages Kubernetes operations via an autonomous **Platform Agent (`platform`)** acting as the master custodian and architect.

- **Agent Configuration (`agents/platform`)**: Contains the system prompt and persona identity (`SOUL.md`), workspace instructions (`AGENTS.md`), runtime configuration (`config.yaml`), operational playbooks (`governance/`) that the scheduled governance jobs point at, their schedules (`cron/jobs.json`), and reusable skills (`skills/`).
- **Kubernetes Operator (`k8s-operator`)**: A Kubebuilder-powered Go operator that manages Custom Resource Definitions (`PlatformAgent`) and reconciles cluster lifecycle state.
- **Integrations**: Supports LiteLLM Gateway for LLM provider routing (Gemini, Vertex AI, OpenAI, Anthropic) and enterprise messaging bridges (Google Chat, Slack).

## Prerequisites & Tooling Matrix

Before beginning installation, ensure your environment meets the requirements for your chosen installation method:

- **Method 0 (Interactive One-Liner)** & **Method 1 (IaC via Terraform + Helm)**: Standard automated deployment using prebuilt container images.
- **Method 2 (Manual Kubernetes / Kustomize)**: Advanced manual manifest deployment.
- **Method 3 (Local Development & Testing)**: Building and running operator binaries and container images locally.

A cluster you bring yourself, rather than one the installer creates, also needs Workload Identity,
NetworkPolicy enforcement, and the rest of the site's
[cluster requirements](docs/site/src/content/docs/install/prerequisites.md#cluster-requirements).

---

## Method 1: The Install Engine — Terraform + Helm

This is the engine [Method 0](#method-0-zero-friction-one-liner-installation-fastest) drives, usable
directly when the install should live in version-controlled IaC (GitOps, CI-driven environments)
instead of an interview. One `terraform apply` of the
[`terraform/examples/full-install`](terraform/examples/full-install/README.md) composition
provisions every GCP resource — the GKE cluster (`cluster_mode = "autopilot"` or `"standard"`, or
`create_cluster = false` for a cluster somebody else made), the agent's identity and IAM, optionally
the Google Chat backend, the GitHub minter's KMS resources, and a Backup for GKE plan — and installs
the [`charts/kube-agents`](charts/kube-agents/README.md) Helm chart on top, which owns every
Kubernetes resource (operator, PlatformAgent CR, LiteLLM gateway, and the optional Hindsight store
and GitHub minter workloads).

- **Canonical guide (self-contained):** [`terraform/examples/full-install/README.md`](terraform/examples/full-install/README.md)
- Drive it through [`lifecycle.sh`](terraform/examples/full-install/lifecycle.sh) rather than bare
  `terraform` commands: `apply` adopts the Cloud KMS resources GCP refuses to delete and any Pub/Sub
  topic or subscription that already exists, `destroy` handles the four teardown asymmetries a bare
  `terraform destroy` trips over, and `plan` reports what an apply would change while creating
  nothing.
- The composition installs `cert-manager` automatically (`enable_cert_manager`, default true), so
  you do **not** need to install it yourself on this path. (You do for
  [Method 2](#method-2-manual-kubernetes-cluster-deployment).) If your pre-existing cluster already
  has `cert-manager` installed, export `SKIP_CERT_MANAGER=true` before running `install.sh` (or set
  `enable_cert_manager = false` in `terraform.tfvars`) so the install does not fail colliding on
  existing CRDs.
- The manual Chat/Slack registrations in
  [Step 5 of this method](#step-5-enable-google-chat--slack-integrations-manual-required-steps)
  apply however the engine is driven.
- The Terraform composition defaults `image_tag` to `"latest"` on `main` (in CI/CD pipelines it is passed explicitly with the test build commit SHA, and on release checkouts or unpacked release bundles it is automatically stamped with the released SemVer version; see the [composition README](terraform/examples/full-install/README.md#the-image_tag-rule)).

### Step-by-Step Execution

#### Step 1: Obtain the Release Sources

Download and extract the self-contained release archive from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/releases) (recommended):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/releases/download/<RELEASE_VERSION>/kube-agents-<RELEASE_VERSION>.tar.gz | tar -xz
cd kube-agents-<RELEASE_VERSION>
```

Alternatively, if you require a Git repository checkout, clone pinned to an official release tag (for example, `0.4.0`):

```bash
git clone --branch <RELEASE_VERSION> https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents.git
cd kube-agents
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not clone `main` to deploy an official release: manifests and CRD schemas on `main` diverge from released container images. A mismatched checkout will fail `verify_local_source_ref` to prevent broken deployments.

#### Step 2: Authenticate with Google Cloud

Authenticate your `gcloud` CLI and set Application Default Credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```

#### Step 3: Apply the Composition

The interactive way is running the official release installer (Method 0 above, or `./install.sh` from this release checkout or unpacked bundle), which writes the
`terraform.tfvars` for you. Hand-driven:

```bash
cd terraform/examples/full-install
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # then edit it
KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_BUCKET=auto ./lifecycle.sh apply
```

- `KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_BUCKET=auto` keeps the Terraform state in a versioned GCS bucket
  (`<project>-kube-agents-tfstate`, prefix `kube-agents/<cluster>`), created on first use. Omit it
  for local state — fine for a hand-driven evaluation, wrong for anything `uninstall.sh` or
  `upgrade.sh` should later find. The state contains every secret the install was given; the
  bucket's IAM is its protection.
- `install.sh` re-runs are idempotent: it loads `install.env` from the first run, regenerates
  `terraform.tfvars` from it, and `terraform apply` reconciles whatever changed. Flags you omit
  keep the value the file records rather than reverting to a default, so bumping `--image-tag`
  alone changes only the image tag. To change configuration, edit `install.env` (copy
  `install.env.example` and `chmod 600` it if the first install has not written one yet — the
  example is tracked world-readable and the file it becomes holds your API keys) and re-run, run
  the installer with `--menu` (e.g. `./install.sh --menu` or `$HOME/kube-agents/install.sh --menu`)
  where Save & Apply re-applies through the same engine, or edit your
  hand-written tfvars and re-apply.

- **Existing Infrastructure Recommendation**: When installing on pre-existing infrastructure (such as an existing GKE cluster or shared VPC), using `./install.sh --generate-only` (see [Generate-Only Mode](#generate-only-mode-recommended-for-existing-infrastructure)) is recommended to auto-generate `terraform.tfvars`, run pre-apply validation checks, and review prerequisites before applying.

- **Private Container Registry**: If your GKE clusters may only pull from an approved registry, see
  [Private container registry](#private-container-registry) below for the full recipe. Mirroring
  only the `kube-agents` images is not enough on its own: `image_registry` (or `install.sh`'s
  `--registry-prefix`) covers the four images this project builds, and LiteLLM, fluent-bit, the
  GitHub token minter and Hindsight need `third_party_image_registry` (or
  `--third-party-registry-prefix`) as well; cert-manager is separate (see the composition README).

- **Dry-run check**: To preview actions without modifying cloud infrastructure:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh | bash -s -- \
    --dry-run \
    --non-interactive \
    --gcp-project-id="my-gcp-project"
  # or, hand-driven from repo, plain:  terraform plan
  ```

#### Security & CMEK Encryption

The automated installer includes local state hardening and Cloud KMS (CMEK) etcd database encryption:

- **Local State Security**: The `install.env` configuration — and the `terraform.tfvars` generated from it — is protected with strict file permissions (`umask 077`, `chmod 600`). An `install.env` the installer wrote is 0600 from the start; one you created by copying `install.env.example` is whatever your umask made it, so `chmod 600` it yourself. `install.sh` tightens a group- or world-readable one when it loads it and prints what it did. The Terraform **state** additionally holds every secret in plaintext; it lives in the versioned GCS state bucket, whose IAM is its protection.
- **GKE Database Encryption (CMEK)**: GKE etcd database encryption is configured automatically using Cloud KMS (`kms_keyring_name` / `kms_key_name`, default `platform-agent-keyring` / `k8s-secret-encryption-key`; `GKE_DB_KMS_KEYRING` / `GKE_DB_KMS_KEY` in `install.env` set both). On a **pre-existing** cluster Terraform cannot enable it, so `install.sh` enables Cloud KMS encryption on the control plane as a `gcloud` pre-step before the apply (a permanent, non-revertible cluster update), reading the same two keys.
- **`ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_SECRETS`**: Set `ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_SECRETS=true` before running `install.sh` against an existing unencrypted cluster to skip that CMEK pre-step (testing environments only).
- **`MIGRATE_NODE_POOLS`**: kube-agents requires Workload Identity (`GKE_METADATA`) to authenticate agent and operator pods. On existing clusters, migrating legacy node pools to `GKE_METADATA` can recreate nodes and restart workloads. Pass `--migrate-node-pools` / `MIGRATE_NODE_POOLS=true` to authorize migration; without opt-in, `install.sh` aborts before making any cluster changes (`REFUSED_MISSING_NODE_POOL_MIGRATION`).
- **`ENABLE_NETWORK_POLICY`**: kube-agents ships NetworkPolicies that isolate the agent's execution sandbox, and they enforce only on Dataplane V2 or with the legacy Calico addon. On an existing GKE Standard cluster with neither, `--enable-network-policy` / `ENABLE_NETWORK_POLICY=true` authorizes enabling Calico, which can recreate nodes and restart workloads. This is one of two answers; without either, `install.sh` aborts before making any cluster changes (`REFUSED_MISSING_NETWORK_POLICY`).
- **`ACCEPT_NO_NETWORK_POLICY`**: the other answer. `--accept-no-network-policy` / `ACCEPT_NO_NETWORK_POLICY=true` installs onto such a cluster without modifying it. Every NetworkPolicy the install ships is then inert, the agent sandbox's included; the choice is recorded in the install report (`network_policy_enforcement`) and on the `PlatformAgent` (`kubeagents.x-k8s.io/network-policy-enforcement`). Record the key in `install.env`, or the next `upgrade.sh` is refused for the enforcement this install accepted; remove it once the cluster enforces, or every later apply waives that check. The site's [Installing without NetworkPolicy enforcement](docs/site/src/content/docs/install/prerequisites.md#installing-without-networkpolicy-enforcement) says exactly what stops being enforced. Mutually exclusive with `ENABLE_NETWORK_POLICY`.
- **`PERSIST_SECRETS_ON_DISK`**: By default (`PERSIST_SECRETS_ON_DISK=true`), credentials (API keys, Slack tokens) are saved to `install.env`. Set `PERSIST_SECRETS_ON_DISK=false` to keep them out of every file the installer writes; they travel to Terraform as `TF_VAR_*` and later runs recover them from the live `platform-agent-secrets` Secret.

#### Private container registry

If your clusters may only pull from an approved registry, copy every image the install needs
there first, then export both registry prefixes before provisioning:

```bash
# Set to the target release tag (e.g. 0.4.0) matching your release installation
export IMAGE_TAG="<RELEASE_VERSION>"

make mirror-images MIRROR_PREFIX=registry.example.com/kube-agents

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh | bash -s -- \
  -y \
  --registry-prefix=registry.example.com/kube-agents \
  --third-party-registry-prefix=registry.example.com/kube-agents
```

`make mirror-images` reads `images.json` at the repository root — the inventory of every image
an install pulls — and copies each one, keeping the trailing image name only.

When using the official release installer (`<RELEASE_VERSION>/install.sh`), the image tag is baked in and matches the release version automatically. Ensure `IMAGE_TAG` used during mirroring matches that exact release version so the mirrored images and install sources stay aligned.

The two flags are separate because the images fall into two groups. `--registry-prefix`
(`image_registry` in tfvars) replaces `ghcr.io/gke-labs/kube-agents` for the images this project
builds — the operator, the agent, and the credential proxy. `--third-party-registry-prefix`
(`third_party_image_registry`) covers the ones it does not: the LiteLLM gateway, the fluent-bit
sidecar, the GitHub token minter, and Hindsight. **Neither implies the other** on the installer
flags, so an install that mirrors everything passes both, as above. (The chart's own
`global.thirdPartyImageRegistry` differs here, deliberately: it defaults to
`global.imageRegistry`.) cert-manager is a separate Helm release the values never reach — see
the composition README's mirrored-registry section for its recipe.

See the [Docker images guide](docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/docker-images.md) for the
inventory, the mirror script's options, the Helm and Terraform equivalents, and how to rebuild
from mirrored base images rather than copying.

#### Step 4: Verify Running Components

Verify that the operator, LiteLLM gateway, and custom resources are healthy:

```bash
kubectl get deployments -n kubeagents-system
kubectl get pods -n kubeagents-system
kubectl get platformagents --all-namespaces
```

#### Step 5: Enable Google Chat & Slack Integrations (Manual Required Steps)

If you enabled Google Chat or Slack during the install, perform the following required manual steps after the apply completes:

##### 1. Google Chat Configuration (`GOOGLE_CHAT_ENABLED=true`)

1. **Configure the Google Chat API endpoint in GCP Console**:
   - Open the Google Chat API configuration page: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/chat.googleapis.com/hangouts-chat?project=<PROJECT_ID>`
   - Set the **App name** to `GKE Platform Agent Bot`.
   - Optionally set an **Avatar URL** pointing at an image you host.
   - Under **Connection settings**, select **Cloud Pub/Sub** and enter the Cloud Pub/Sub topic created during provisioning:
     ```text
     projects/<PROJECT_ID>/topics/<CHAT_TOPIC_NAME>
     ```
   - Under **Visibility**, select **Specific people and groups in your domain** and enter your email address (`ALLOWED_USERS`).
2. **Send a Test Direct Message**:
   - Send a DM to the bot in Google Chat with the message `"Hi Platform Agent"`.
3. **Approve Pairing Code (Optional / First-time setup)**:
   - If pairing mode is enabled, approve the pairing code displayed in the gateway logs:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it deploy/platform-agent-gateway -n kubeagents-system -- hermes pairing approve google_chat <PAIRING_CODE>
     ```
   - Re-display these instructions at any time from the repository root:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/installer/print_instructions_gchat.sh
     ```

##### 2. Slack Configuration (`SLACK_ENABLED=true`)

1. **Verify Slack App Settings**:
   - Ensure **Socket Mode** is enabled in your Slack App console.
   - Verify that your Bot Token (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`) holds every bot scope in the manifest `hermes slack manifest` emits (step 4 below). At the Hermes tag in [`tags.env`](tags.env) that list is `app_mentions:read`, `assistant:write`, `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `chat:write`, `commands`, `files:read`, `files:write`, `groups:history`, `groups:read`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `im:write`, `mpim:history`, `mpim:read`, `reactions:read`, `reactions:write`, `users:read`. Regenerate it from the command rather than editing this line: `reactions:write` is added by [`deploy/docker/patches/apply_slack_reactions_scope.py`](deploy/docker/patches/apply_slack_reactions_scope.py) rather than by Hermes, and `--no-assistant` drops `assistant:write`. If the app does not exist yet, create it from that manifest (**Create New App → From a manifest**) instead of ticking scopes by hand; the command reads nothing from Slack, so it runs on an install where Slack is not configured.
   - The `*:history` scopes are the ones a hand-built app most often lacks. `im:read` grants the conversation metadata; the text of a DM arrives on `message.im`, which needs `im:history`, and `groups:history` and `mpim:history` do the same for private and group channels. A bot without them connects normally and is never sent the message; the only symptom is a DM that goes unanswered.
   - `files:write` is the one that is easy to miss, because omitting it looks like nothing is wrong. A card whose answer is text is delivered normally; a card that produces a **file** has its upload rejected with `missing_scope`, which the artifact delivery path catches and logs as a warning. The user is told the task completed and never sees the artifact. Add the scope and reinstall the app.
   - `reactions:write` fails more quietly still. The agent puts 👀 on a message when it picks the work up and adds ✅ or ❌ beside it when the turn ends; without the scope Slack rejects each of those with `missing_scope`, the adapter logs it at debug and carries on, and the answer still arrives. The only symptom is that no reaction ever appears. Add the scope and reinstall.
2. **Test Bot Connection**:
   - Invite the bot to a channel or send a direct message: `"Hi Platform Agent"`.
3. **Approve Pairing Code (Optional / First-time setup)**:
   - If pairing mode is enabled, approve the pairing code displayed in the gateway logs:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it deploy/platform-agent-gateway -n kubeagents-system -- hermes pairing approve slack <PAIRING_CODE>
     ```
4. **Register the Native Slash Commands (Optional)**:
   - Slack routes a leading-slash message to the app's slash handler only if that slash is registered on the app. Generate the manifest:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec deploy/platform-agent-gateway -n kubeagents-system -- hermes slack manifest
     ```
   - Paste the JSON into the Slack App Console (**Features → App Manifest → Edit**), save, and reinstall when Slack prompts. That manifest replaces the whole app definition — to keep an app you have already configured, add `--slashes-only` and merge the printed array into the existing `features.slash_commands`.
   - This adds Slack's autocomplete, not the behaviour: a typed `/hermes <subcommand>` works either way, because the Planning Agent's `legacy_slash_commands` plugin unwraps it before the gateway resolves the command.
5. **Set the Home Channel (if you left `SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL` empty)**:
   - Scheduled audits have nowhere to post until one is set. From the Slack channel you want, run `/sethome` (or `/hermes sethome`). It takes effect immediately and persists across restarts.

- Re-display these instructions at any time from the repository root:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/installer/print_instructions_slack.sh
  ```

#### Step 6: Talk to the Agent With No Chat Platform

Both chat integrations are opt-in and off by default, so an install that enabled neither reaches
the agent over `kubectl exec`. `install.sh` prints these two commands when you choose "None" at the
chat prompt and again when it finishes, with the cluster, region, project and namespace already
filled in:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <CLUSTER_NAME> --location <REGION> --project <PROJECT_ID> --dns-endpoint
kubectl exec -it deployment/platform-agent-gateway -n kubeagents-system -c platform-agent -- hermes -p platform
```

- `--dns-endpoint` applies only to a cluster that publishes an externally reachable DNS endpoint;
  `gcloud` rejects the flag on one that does not, so drop it there. The installer decides per
  cluster ([`scripts/installer/gke_dns_endpoint.sh`](scripts/installer/gke_dns_endpoint.sh)).
- `-c platform-agent` selects the Hermes container; the gateway pod runs three, so omitting it
  works but makes `kubectl` warn about which one it picked.
- `-p platform` reaches the Platform Agent directly. A bare `hermes` reaches the Planning Agent
  front door, which is where a chat message would have landed. See the site's
  [ChatOps](docs/site/src/content/docs/concepts/chatops.md) for the difference and for what a
  chat-less install does not exercise.
- `kubectl port-forward` is not an alternative here: the agent runs sandboxed under gVisor by
  default and the forward cannot see into the sandbox. `kubectl exec` enters it.

To add a chat platform later, re-run the installer with `--enable-google-chat` or `--enable-slack`
and follow Step 5.

---

## The Shell Sandbox

Every command the model writes runs in `platform-agent-shell-0`, a pod of its own that holds no
credentials and is reached over SSH. It is not optional and there is nothing to turn on: the
operator refuses `shellSandbox.enabled: false` with `Degraded`/`ShellSandboxCannotBeDisabled`, and
the chart fails the render rather than installing something that would sit `Degraded`. The SSH
keypair it needs is minted for you by `install.sh`, by the Terraform composition, and by
`upgrade.sh` on an install that predates it, so there is no key ceremony; on Method 2 you mint it
yourself in [Step 2](#step-2-create-api-key--access-secrets).

The one thing left to choose is the container runtime. `gvisor` puts a user-space kernel under the
sandbox pod and needs a GKE Sandbox node pool; on Standard clusters `enable_gvisor_node_pool = true`
builds one, and Autopilot ships the `gvisor` RuntimeClass with no pool to manage. Leave it empty to
run on the node's standard runtime.

Set it on a new install by adding this to `terraform.tfvars` before the first apply
([Method 1](#method-1-the-install-engine--terraform--helm), Step 3):

```hcl
cluster_mode            = "standard" # omit both lines on Autopilot, which
enable_gvisor_node_pool = true       # provides the gvisor RuntimeClass natively

extra_helm_values = {
  platformAgent = { harness = { experimental = { shellSandbox = {
    runtimeClassName = "gvisor"
  } } } }
}
```

Or on an existing one:

```bash
helm upgrade kube-agents ./charts/kube-agents \
  --namespace kubeagents-system --reuse-values \
  --set platformAgent.harness.experimental.shellSandbox.runtimeClassName=gvisor \
  --wait --timeout 10m
```

Confirm it took: `kubectl get pod platform-agent-shell-0 -n kubeagents-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.runtimeClassName}'`.

On an install that came from `install.sh`, put the same value in `extra_helm_values` in
`terraform/examples/full-install/terraform.tfvars` as well. The next `upgrade.sh` or `install.sh`
re-run regenerates that file from `install.env`, which does not record this setting, and reverts a
value set only on the Helm release.

Installing the chart directly with `helm install` gives you a sandbox the agent cannot log into: the
chart cannot generate an `authorized_keys`-form public key, so `platform-agent-shell-authorized-keys`
renders empty. Supply the keypair yourself in `platformAgent.credentials.data`
(`SANDBOX_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SANDBOX_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`) or use Method 1.

---

## Method 2: Manual Kubernetes Cluster Deployment

If you are installing into an existing Kubernetes or GKE cluster without using the automated GCP provisioning pipeline, follow these steps.

### Step 1: Install cert-manager

The Kubernetes Operator requires `cert-manager` (version `1.13.0+`) to generate and rotate admission webhook TLS certificates.

> Only needed on this manual path. [Method 1](#method-1-the-install-engine--terraform--helm) installs `cert-manager` for you.

- **Standard Kubernetes / GKE Standard Cluster (via Helm)**:

  ```bash
  helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
  helm repo update
  helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
    --namespace cert-manager \
    --create-namespace \
    --set installCRDs=true
  ```

- **GKE Autopilot Cluster (Leader Election Workaround)**:
  GKE Autopilot restricts coordination Leases in `kube-system`. Disable leader election during install:
  ```bash
  helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
    --namespace cert-manager \
    --create-namespace \
    --set installCRDs=true \
    --set controller.leaderElection.enabled=false \
    --set cainjector.leaderElection.enabled=false
  ```

### Step 2: Create API Key & Access Secrets

Create the `kubeagents-system` namespace and add your model provider credentials:

```bash
kubectl create namespace kubeagents-system --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

KEY_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
ssh-keygen -q -t ed25519 -N '' -C kube-agents-shell-sandbox -f "$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519"

kubectl create secret generic platform-agent-secrets \
  --namespace kubeagents-system \
  --from-literal=GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key" \
  --from-literal=API_SERVER_KEY="your-api-server-key" \
  --from-literal=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key" \
  --from-literal=OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key" \
  --from-literal=SESSION_KV_API_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --from-literal=SESSION_KV_SALT="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --from-file=SANDBOX_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY="$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519" \
  --from-file=SANDBOX_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY="$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519.pub" &&
  kubectl create secret generic platform-agent-shell-authorized-keys \
    --namespace kubeagents-system \
    --from-file=authorized_keys="$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519.pub" --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

rm -rf "$KEY_DIR"
```

The SSH pair is how the agent reaches [the shell sandbox](#the-shell-sandbox); `--from-file`
reads the private key whole, so its newlines need no quoting. The public half goes into a second
Secret because the sandbox mounts its `authorized_keys` from there and must not mount
`platform-agent-secrets`, which holds every model API key. The Helm chart renders
`platform-agent-shell-authorized-keys` from the pair; nothing on this path does, so create it here.
The name derives from the `PlatformAgent`'s `metadata.name`, which Step 6 sets to `platform-agent`.
The two creates are chained so an `AlreadyExists` on `platform-agent-secrets` stops the block before
the authorized-keys Secret is written; that error means the install predates this step, and the
upgrade note further down this section is the path for it, not a re-run. The authorized-keys create
goes through `kubectl apply`, so a re-run after deleting `platform-agent-secrets` leaves
`authorized_keys` matching the pair just minted rather than an earlier one.

The Session KV values are generated, not chosen: `SESSION_KV_API_KEY` is the bearer token
for the pod-local Session KV server, and `SESSION_KV_SALT` is the HMAC salt that
pseudonymises chat identities before they are written to disk, and, when the
chart's `litellm.redaction` is on, also keys the `[ip:…]` and `[<rule>:…]`
pseudonyms the gateway substitutes into provider requests. Keep the salt:
rotating it re-anonymises every user, severing their past sessions from their
future ones, and gives every pseudonymised identifier a new token the model
cannot correlate with the old one.

Both are optional in the sense that the pod still starts without them, but
`SESSION_KV_API_KEY` is not optional in practice: the in-pod `k8s-event-watcher`
authenticates with it, treats an empty value as fatal, and exits on every start
— so **no cluster events are watched at all**, in a container that stays Ready
and a CR whose `.status` says nothing. The Session KV server also answers `503`
to every request (losing chat-thread resolution and incident lookup), and
identity pseudonyms stop being stable across pod restarts. If you are upgrading
an installation that predates these keys, `upgrade.sh` adds them to the existing
Secret on a Helm or Terraform install before it rolls the agent; on this path,
add them by hand:

```bash
kubectl patch secret platform-agent-secrets -n kubeagents-system --type=merge \
  -p "{\"stringData\":{\"SESSION_KV_API_KEY\":\"$(openssl rand -hex 32)\",\"SESSION_KV_SALT\":\"$(openssl rand -hex 32)\"}}"
kubectl rollout restart deployment/platform-agent-gateway -n kubeagents-system
```

The restart buys promptness, not correctness: the operator notices the changed
Secret within fifteen minutes and rolls the gateway itself. See
[Rotating a Secret rolls the pod](docs/site/src/content/docs/operator/platformagent-crd.md#rotating-a-secret-rolls-the-pod).

A Method 2 install made before Step 2 minted the shell sandbox keypair (any install whose
`platform-agent-secrets` has no `SANDBOX_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`) lacks it, and `upgrade.sh` does not run
on this path. The symptom is `<name>-shell-0` stuck in `ContainerCreating` with a `FailedMount` on
`<name>-shell-authorized-keys`, where `<name>` is the PlatformAgent's `metadata.name`
(`platformagent` if you applied the sample unmodified, `platform-agent` if you followed the current
Step 6), and the `PlatformAgent` `Degraded` with reason `ShellSandboxKeysMissing`. This block
generates the pair and adds both Secrets only when either half is absent; a complete pair already
present is left alone, because replacing a key the sandbox trusts locks the agent out of its shell.

```bash
AGENT_NAME="$(kubectl get platformagents -n kubeagents-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')"
if [ -z "$AGENT_NAME" ]; then
  echo "no PlatformAgent found in kubeagents-system" >&2
elif [ -z "$(kubectl get secret platform-agent-secrets -n kubeagents-system -o jsonpath='{.data.SANDBOX_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY}')" ] ||
  [ -z "$(kubectl get secret platform-agent-secrets -n kubeagents-system -o jsonpath='{.data.SANDBOX_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY}')" ]; then
  KEY_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
  ssh-keygen -q -t ed25519 -N '' -C kube-agents-shell-sandbox -f "$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519" &&
    kubectl patch secret platform-agent-secrets -n kubeagents-system --type=merge \
      -p "{\"data\":{\"SANDBOX_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY\":\"$(base64 < "$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519" | tr -d '\n')\",\"SANDBOX_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY\":\"$(base64 < "$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519.pub" | tr -d '\n')\"}}" &&
    kubectl create secret generic "${AGENT_NAME}-shell-authorized-keys" \
      --namespace kubeagents-system \
      --from-file=authorized_keys="$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519.pub" --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
  rm -rf "$KEY_DIR"
fi
```

This patches `data` with base64 rather than `stringData` with the raw key because the private key
has newlines and the patch is interpolated into JSON; `tr -d '\n'` because macOS `base64` has no
`-w0`. The steps are chained so a failed patch does not go on to create the authorized-keys Secret,
which would clear `ShellSandboxKeysMissing` while the gateway still has no private key. If
`platform-agent-secrets` holds the pair but `<name>-shell-authorized-keys` is missing, or both
halves are present yet the agent's commands fail with `Permission denied (publickey)` (the
authorized-keys Secret kept a public key from an earlier pair, which the operator's existence check
cannot see), this creates or replaces it from the stored public half and runs nothing on an empty
value; then restart as below:

```bash
AGENT_NAME="$(kubectl get platformagents -n kubeagents-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" && [ -n "$AGENT_NAME" ] &&
  SANDBOX_PUB="$(kubectl get secret platform-agent-secrets -n kubeagents-system -o jsonpath='{.data.SANDBOX_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY}' | base64 --decode)" && [ -n "$SANDBOX_PUB" ] &&
  printf '%s\n' "$SANDBOX_PUB" | kubectl create secret generic "${AGENT_NAME}-shell-authorized-keys" -n kubeagents-system --from-file=authorized_keys=/dev/stdin --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Then restart the gateway and the shell StatefulSet. For this key the restart is required, not a
convenience: the operator does not roll the gateway for a mounted Secret, and the `sandbox-ssh-key`
init container copies the private key out of it only at pod start. A shell pod still in
`ContainerCreating` needs no restart: the kubelet mounts the new Secret on its next retry and the
pod starts. The StatefulSet restart is for a sandbox that was already running, which otherwise
keeps the `authorized_keys` it installed at start.

```bash
AGENT_NAME="$(kubectl get platformagents -n kubeagents-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" && [ -n "$AGENT_NAME" ] &&
  kubectl rollout restart deployment/"${AGENT_NAME}-gateway" statefulset/"${AGENT_NAME}-shell" -n kubeagents-system
```

Vertex AI needs no entry here: `MODEL_PROVIDER=vertex` authenticates with Workload Identity
(see [Inference gateway](docs/site/src/content/docs/concepts/inference-gateway.md#vertex-ai-and-model-garden)).

### Step 3: Build & Push the Operator Image

Set your registry destination and build the container image:

```bash
cd k8s-operator

# An immutable tag: `make deploy` refuses a floating tag such as `latest`, because it
# lets a pod reschedule upgrade the controller past the RBAC applied with it.
# Set ALLOW_MUTABLE_IMG=1 only for a cluster you will discard.
export IMG=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<YOUR_PROJECT>/<YOUR_REPO>/kube-agents-operator:$(git rev-parse HEAD)

make docker-build IMG=$IMG
make docker-push IMG=$IMG
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Operator & CRDs

Install the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and deploy the controller manager deployment:

```bash
make install
make deploy IMG=$IMG
```

Then apply the agent-RBAC admission policies. `make deploy` does **not** include them — they are
deliberately outside the kustomize overlay, because its `namePrefix` would rewrite each policy's
name without rewriting the `spec.policyName` its binding refers to, leaving both bindings pointing
at nothing and the policies silently inert:

```bash
# Kubernetes 1.30+ only (ValidatingAdmissionPolicy v1). Skip on older clusters -- unlike
# the chart, which checks the version itself, this apply will fail there.
kubectl apply -f config/admission/agent-rbac-policy.yaml
```

[Method 1](#method-1-the-install-engine--terraform--helm) gets these from the chart and needs no
such step. Skipping it here leaves agent RBAC without its admission backstop. Read that file's
header for what the policies do and do not enforce — notably, they cannot check the rules of a role
that a binding merely _references_.

If the agent images are mirrored into a private registry, tell the operator where to find them.
These two are the images it resolves at reconcile time rather than reading from a manifest — the
agent image for a `PlatformAgent` that omits `spec.deployment.image`, and the logging sidecar it
injects into every agent pod — so nothing else sets them:

```bash
kubectl set env deployment/kubeagents-controller-manager -n kubeagents-system \
  PLATFORM_AGENT_IMAGE=registry.example.com/kube-agents/platform-agent:latest \
  FLUENT_BIT_IMAGE=registry.example.com/kube-agents/fluent-bit:5.1.2
```

The Helm chart does this for you when a registry prefix
is in effect; the commands above are for a hand-rolled `make deploy`. The credential-proxy
sidecar needs no variable — the operator derives it from the agent image. See the
[Docker images guide](docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/docker-images.md) for all override env
vars and their precedence.

Verify controller readiness:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment -n kubeagents-system
```

### Step 5: Deploy Integrations (LiteLLM & GitHub)

To optionally deploy the LiteLLM Gateway or GitHub Token Minter:

`make deploy-github` renders the minter's Kubernetes half and imports nothing, so on this path the GitHub App and the Cloud KMS asymmetric signing key — the latter already holding the imported private key — must exist beforehand (see the [upstream guide](https://github.com/abcxyz/github-token-minter#readme) and [Token minter guide](docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/token-minter.md)). `install.sh --github-pem-path` performs that import for you; this path has no equivalent.

`GITHUB_ORG` must be a GitHub **organization**. The Token Minter looks App installations up at `/orgs/{org}/installation`, which does not exist for personal accounts, so a user-owned GitOps repo deploys cleanly and then fails every token request with a 404. This manual path skips the installer's preflight check — see [`k8s-operator/config/integrations/github/README.md`](k8s-operator/config/integrations/github/README.md).

`GITHUB_ORG`/`GITHUB_REPO` here, not the `GITOPS_ORG`/`GITOPS_REPO` the installer takes: this is the hand-driven `make deploy-github` path, whose envsubst allowlist in `k8s-operator/Makefile` passes the `GITHUB_*` names. The rename is scoped to the installer's own inputs.

```bash
# Deploy LiteLLM Gateway
export MODEL_PROVIDER=gemini
export MODEL_DEFAULT_NAME=gemini-3.5-flash
# For MODEL_PROVIDER=vertex_ai also export PROJECT_ID, LITELLM_KSA_NAME,
# LITELLM_GSA_NAME, VERTEX_PROJECT_ID, and VERTEX_LOCATION — the vertex overlay
# renders the gateway's Workload Identity ServiceAccount from them.
make deploy-litellm

# Deploy GitHub Integration (requires pre-provisioned Cloud KMS key and pre-created credentials secret)
kubectl create secret generic github-app-credentials \
  --namespace kubeagents-system \
  --from-literal=app-id="your-github-app-id"

export PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
export REGION="your-gcp-region"
export CLUSTER_NAME="your-gke-cluster-name"
export KMS_LOCATION="your-kms-region" # a region; Cloud KMS has no zonal locations
export KMS_KEYRING="your-kms-keyring"
export KMS_KEY="your-kms-key"
export KMS_KEY_VERSION="your-kms-key-version"
export GITHUB_ORG="your-github-org"
export GITHUB_REPO="your-github-repo"
export GITHUB_MINTER_KSA_NAME="kubeagents-github-minter"
export GITHUB_MINTER_GSA_NAME="kubeagents-github-minter-gsa"
export PLATFORM_AGENT_GSA_NAME="kubeagents-platform-gsa"
make deploy-github
```

### Step 6: Apply Custom Resources

Submit a sample `PlatformAgent` Custom Resource to activate cluster governance (run inside `k8s-operator/`).
The `sed` renames the CR from `platformagent` to `platform-agent`, because the operator derives
`platform-agent-gateway`, `platform-agent-shell-0` and `platform-agent-shell-authorized-keys` from
the CR name and those are the names this guide uses, and drops the sample's
`spec.harness.hermes.apiServerSecretRef`, which names a Secret that does not exist. With the field
absent the operator uses `platform-agent-secrets` / `API_SERVER_KEY` as an optional reference, so
the gateway starts even before that entry exists. This step is for a first install. On an existing
install keep the CR you have: the webhook admits one per cluster ("only one PlatformAgent is
allowed per cluster"), so re-applying under a new name is refused, and the upgrade note in Step 2
derives its names from whichever CR exists.

```bash
sed -e 's/^  name: platformagent$/  name: platform-agent/' \
    -e '/^      apiServerSecretRef:$/,/^        key: "api-key"$/d' \
    examples/platformagent.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl get platformagents -A
```

## Method 3: Local Development & Fast Iteration

### kind

`hack/kind-up.sh` builds the images from the checkout, creates a kind cluster, installs the chart
with LiteLLM routed to the Gemini API (`GEMINI_API_KEY`), and prints the command that runs a bench
case against it. It sets `harness.location: kind` on the `PlatformAgent`, which the operator reads
as "no GKE cluster": the credential proxy uses the cluster it runs in and no `GKE_*` variables are
set. Most of the evals depend on GKE or GCP and cannot run there. `--delete` removes the cluster.

### The operator against a cluster you already have

For fast iteration on the operator itself, against a GKE cluster or the kind cluster above:

1. **Set your active Kubernetes context**:
   ```bash
   kubectl config current-context
   ```
2. **Install CRDs**:
   ```bash
   cd k8s-operator
   make install
   ```
3. **Run the controller locally with webhooks disabled**:
   ```bash
   ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false make run
   ```
4. **Fast Remote Rebuild & Update**:
   To rebuild and push an updated container image and trigger immediate deployment rollout in GKE:
   ```bash
   make dev-rebuild-agent ARGS="platform"
   ```

## Upgrading

To move a configured `kube-agents` installation to a newer release, run the `upgrade.sh` published
for that release. It carries its own version, so the run names no image tag, and it reuses the
install checkout — and the `install.env` in it — that `install.sh` left in `$HOME/kube-agents`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/<RELEASE_VERSION>/upgrade.sh | bash -s -- \
  --non-interactive \
  --gcp-project-id="<PROJECT_ID>" \
  --gke-cluster-name="<CLUSTER_NAME>" \
  --gcp-region="<REGION>"
```

From a checkout, run `./upgrade.sh` with the same flags. An unpacked release bundle carries sources
and no configuration, so copy the install's `install.env` into it first, or point
`KUBE_AGENTS_INSTALL_ENV` at one. `--image-tag` overrides the version the script carries and exists
for development and CI/CD testing; `--plan` reports what a full upgrade would change without
changing anything. The upgrade modes, the previews, and the refusals are in
[the Upgrade page](docs/site/src/content/docs/install/upgrade.md).

## Teardown & Cleanup

To safely remove provisioned resources:

### Automated Uninstallation

To remove the resources created for one configured `kube-agents` installation:

```bash
./uninstall.sh --non-interactive \
  --gcp-project-id="<PROJECT_ID>" \
  --gke-cluster-name="<CLUSTER_NAME>" \
  --gcp-region="<REGION>"
```

### Automated Cloud Teardown

`uninstall.sh` above delegates to `lifecycle.sh destroy`, which is also usable directly from a
checkout:

```bash
cd terraform/examples/full-install
KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_BUCKET=auto ./lifecycle.sh destroy
```

`destroy` handles the four asymmetries a bare `terraform destroy` trips over: it deletes the
PlatformAgent CR up front (force-clearing a wedged finalizer), purges the backups a BackupPlan
still owns, clears the cluster's deletion protection, and forgets the undeletable Cloud KMS
resources from state so their key versions are never scheduled for destruction — the next
`lifecycle.sh apply` adopts them back automatically.

With **no Terraform state** (none in the GCS bucket, none locally), `uninstall.sh` says so and
stops with exit **3**, touching nothing. Either nothing is installed against those coordinates,
or the install was made by a release that predates this engine — re-run it with
`--source-ref=<that release>` so the matching teardown runs.

### Manual Local Uninstall

To uninstall the operator controller and CRDs manually:

```bash
cd k8s-operator
make undeploy
make uninstall
```

---

## Troubleshooting & Common FAQ

### 1. Workload Identity Authorization Errors (`403 Permission Denied`)

- Ensure the GKE Kubernetes Service Account (`kubeagents-system/kubeagents-platform-agent` by default) is correctly annotated with the GCP Service Account email (`iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account`).
- Verify IAM bindings using:
  ```bash
  gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy <GSA_EMAIL>
  ```

### 2. Admission Webhook Errors (`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`)

- Confirm `cert-manager` pods are running in the `cert-manager` namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
  ```
- If running the controller locally via `make run`, ensure `ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false` is explicitly set to bypass webhooks.

### 3. GKE Autopilot Pod Pending on Lease Resources

- Check if your deployment is stuck waiting for leader election Leases in `kube-system`. Disable leader election arguments `--leader-elect=false` when deploying controllers to GKE Autopilot clusters.

### 4. Agent Pod Crashlooping, or CLIs Reporting `credential proxy unavailable`

- `gcloud`/`kubectl` in the shell sandbox are wrappers around the credential proxy, which runs in a Pod of its own, so a failed proxy looks like broken tooling rather than a failed container. Read the proxy's log first:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -n kubeagents-system deploy/platform-agent-credential-proxy
  ```
- For the symptoms, what they mean, and how to check the Pod's identity from outside the sandbox, see the [credential isolation troubleshooting section](docs/site/src/content/docs/reference/credential-isolation.md#troubleshooting).
