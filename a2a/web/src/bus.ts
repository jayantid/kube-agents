/**
 * The browser's connection to the bus: one websocket, one JetStream tap per
 * provisioned stream, two pollers, a wall-clock tick, and - for the console
 * user - the conversation link.
 *
 * The page connects as `console`. Its grants are the web user's JetStream
 * read surface (STREAM.INFO and CONSUMER.INFO on the four streams included -
 * `web` already holds both, so the pollers below work under either user)
 * plus publish on `chat.console.*.in` and subscribe on `chat.console.*.out`
 * (dev/nats.conf mirrors the operator render). It still cannot publish
 * anywhere on `a2a.>`, and the verify button demonstrates that live. The
 * gateway turns a console frame into a task, so every turn the page sends
 * comes back on TASKS like anyone else's.
 *
 * Mechanics the grants dictate: the inbox prefix must be `_INBOX.<user>` or
 * every JS API reply is unsubscribable; consumers are ephemeral ordered
 * *pull* consumers, because the grant enumerates
 * `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<stream>.>` and `MSG.NEXT.<stream>.*` per stream
 * and nothing wider; and there are four streams, not one, so there are four
 * attach loops that each retry independently. A fresh install grows its
 * streams one provisioning Job at a time and the page lights up as they
 * appear.
 *
 * Connecting as `web` still works for the read-only view: no `.out`
 * subscription, no input box, and the pollers work exactly the same - only
 * the console link is unavailable.
 *
 * A publish made while the link is down is lost without an error. nats.ws
 * does not throw: it buffers the bytes in its outbound queue, and every dial
 * attempt starts with `resetOutbound()` (in `prepare()`), which empties that
 * queue and rejects the pongs a pending `flush()` is waiting on. So the page
 * refuses to send while the link is down, and races each send's flush to
 * report a turn that was published just as the socket died.
