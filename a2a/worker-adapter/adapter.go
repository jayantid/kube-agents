	// NATSUser/NATSPassword are the static-credential path. Nothing in this
	// repo spawns a worker with them any more — the gateway's spawner is the

	// gke-labs#1270, and BusTokenFile is what replaced them. The path stays
	// for a run by hand against a bus with no callout in front of it, which
	// is still a bus this deployment renders. When the last static user goes
	// from nats.conf, these go with it.
	NATSUser     string
	NATSPassword string

	// BusTokenFile is the projected ServiceAccount token the pod
	// authenticates with, audience-bound to the bus and bound by the kubelet
	// to this pod. Set, it wins over NATSUser: the callout derives this
	// session's grants from the pod the API server attests, so the identity
	// is the pod rather than anything this process was told.
	BusTokenFile string

	// PodName is the pod's own name from the downward API, and under the
	// callout it is the identity: the NATS user is named for it and the
	// grants — subjects, consumer names, inbox prefix — are all built from
	// it. It equals Session by construction (the gateway names the pod after
	// the bus session), and the adapter checks that rather than trusting
	// either, because a mismatch is silent: the connection succeeds and
	// every reply goes to an inbox the grants do not cover.
	PodName string

	// TaskID names the one task this process exists for.
	TaskID string
	// Profile is the persona the pod boots (PROFILE env); rides from.profile.
	Profile string
	// Session is the executor's bus session name (A2A_SESSION env) - the
	// addressee token on the task subjects for gateway-spawned session pods.
	// Empty means the addressee is the profile (dispatcher-spawned shape).
	Session string

	// OriginSeq is the TASKS stream sequence of the submission this process
	// exists to execute, from the spawner's own PubAck (lib.EnvOriginSeq).
	//
	// Zero means nobody told us, and the two ways that happens are not the
	// same. A spawner older than the variable, a by-hand run, and the
	// dispatcher-spawned shape all leave it unset, and those fall back to
	// scanning the subject. A current spawner that could not determine a
	// sequence sends lib.OriginSeqUnknown instead, which OriginSeqStated
	// records: the fallback is the same read, but it is a read we know is
	// unverifiable rather than one we assume is fine.
	OriginSeq uint64
	// OriginSeqStated is true when the spawner set lib.EnvOriginSeq at all,
	// whatever it said. It separates "not told" from "told: unknown".

	// stub; the pod default is the native binary with the stream-json flags.
	HarnessCommand []string
	// HarnessEnv is the complete environment for the harness subprocess.
	HarnessEnv []string

	// Namespace is the pod's own namespace (POD_NAMESPACE), used only to
	// default Scope the same way the gateway defaults its ceiling.
	Namespace string

	// Scope is the resource path this executor operates in, and it is what
	// the capability is checked against: not "may this capability do
	// anything" but "may it execute here". A capability the gateway
	// narrowed below this pod's scope — or one a hop narrowed elsewhere —
	// fails that question, which is the whole point of asking it.
	//
	// It comes from A2A_AUTHORITY_SCOPE, rendered onto every session pod by
	// the gateway's own spawner — not by the operator, which renders no
	// authority environment at all. The gateway renders its own RESOLVED
	// value rather than passing its variable through, because the scope the
	// executor checks against has to be the one the gateway minted under.
	// Unset falls back to Namespace above, which is right for a local run
	// and wrong in a pod: see spawn.go's note on `namespace/-`.
	Scope capability.Scope

	// CapabilityOptional governs exactly one thing: what a submission with
	// no capability at all means. Zero value — the safe one — refuses it.
	// Set, it executes and says so at WARN. That is the mixed-version
	// window: a gateway that predates the mint in front of an executor
	// that enforces it, and nothing else.
	//
	// It is NOT a switch for enforcement. A capability that is present is
	// always checked and its refusal is always honoured; there is no
	// configuration in which this executor runs work a verifier refused.

	// activeDeadlineSeconds so the failure is ours to report, not the
