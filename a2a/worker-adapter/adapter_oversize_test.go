// TestLifecycle_OversizeResultLineFailsWithTheCeilingNamed pins what a result
// line past scannerMaxBytes does. It does not truncate, and it must not stall.
//
// It used to stall. The scanner stopped with bufio.ErrTooLong and nothing
// drained stdout, so the harness blocked forever writing into a full 64KB pipe,
// cmd.Wait never returned, and the task ran to TaskDeadline -- 1800s in
// production -- reporting `deadline-exceeded`. That reason is worse than no
// reason: it sends the next debugger after a slow model when the answer is a
// full pipe.
//
// Now the scan goroutine drains and discards after the error, so the child
// exits, cmd.Wait returns, and the terminal reason names the ceiling and its
// value. The deliverable is still refused rather than truncated, which is the
// deliberate half: a silently shortened answer is worse than a loud failure,
// and a line this size means a model dumped a file into its result.
//
// The deadline here is injected and generous on purpose. It has to be injected
// so a regression fails in a minute instead of hanging for the production
// 1800s, and generous because a deadline-based test that waits on a stall is
// exactly the shape that flakes -- this PR already fixed one that failed CI at
// 15.12s against a 15s bound.

// TestLifecycle_OversizeLineWithAHarnessThatWaitsOnStdin is the version of the

// keeps reading stdin rather than exiting.
//
// That difference is the whole finding. The real harness is an agent loop whose
// turn ends when the adapter closes stdin; the `result` arm does that, and the
// scan-error path did not. So the drain blocked on a pipe that never closed,
// the goroutine never returned, `close(events)` never ran, `cmd.Wait` was never
// reached, and the task parked until TaskDeadline -- publishing
// `deadline-exceeded` and never reaching the ceiling diagnostic. A stub that
// exits on its own hides all of it.
