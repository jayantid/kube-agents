	// EphemeralConsumerInactiveThreshold is how long the server keeps an
	// ephemeral consumer this module creates on TASKS after its last client
	// went away. TasksGet sets it on the replay's ordered consumer and the
	// worker adapter sets it on a session's named consumers, so the two
	// reap on the same clock.
	//
	// It is set explicitly because nats.go's ordered-consumer default is five
	// MINUTES (v1.53.1, jetstream/ordered.go:635; the caller's value replaces
	// it only when non-zero, :646), and stopping an ordered iterator never
	// deletes the consumer behind it (orderedSubscription.Stop, :364). With
	// the default in place every tasks/get left a consumer on TASKS for five
	// minutes, so the count tracked the call rate over that window rather
	// than the replays in flight, against a max_consumers sized for the
	// latter (#1739).
	//
	// The threshold is the only cleanup: TasksGet does not delete the
	// consumer it creates, and must not be made to. The delete is a publish
	// on $JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.TASKS.*, a subject the rendered bridge
	// grant withholds, and a refused publish on a request subject gets no
	// reply at all -- the caller blocks to its own deadline while the
	// violation arrives out of band, on the connection's async error
	// handler. Both halves were measured: re-adding a synchronous delete
	// here takes a replay from 0.11s to 30.07s and logs one Error-level
	// permissions violation per call, which is the line an operator is
	// taught to read as a missing grant.
	//
	// Widening the grant instead is the fix that suggests itself, and it is
	// worse than the leak it closes. A wildcard is the only form on offer:
	// nats.go names an ordered consumer <prefix>_<serial> and bumps the
	// serial on every reset (v1.53.1, jetstream/ordered.go:629), so no
	// exact-name grant can cover one. And DELETE.TASKS.* is a wildcard over
	// consumer names, not over the consumers its holder created, so it would
	// hand everything carrying the bridge password delete on any consumer on
	// TASKS -- the gateway's own gateway-relay durable included. That is the
	// same argument sessionConsumer makes for MSG.NEXT in the worker adapter
	// (adapter.go:816), and the stated reason the adapter uses named
	// consumers rather than ordered ones. Reclaim the slot sooner by
	// shortening this constant, not by adding a delete or a grant.
