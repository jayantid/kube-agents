# The Hermes bridge

- **Author:** [@bnaylor]
- **Date:** 2026-08-26
- **Status:** draft for review
- **Companions:** the A2A payload spec (task lifecycle, steering), the NATS deployment
  spec (accounts), the subagent profiles spec (supervision, CAS)

## Purpose

The retargeted first wave routes every gateway task to the addressee `platform`, and
nothing answers on that subject yet - the worker adapter (W4) fast-follows, and the
dispatcher is stage 3. The bridge is the stand-in executor: a small Go daemon on
`a2a/lib` that consumes tasks addressed to `platform`, runs
`hermes -p platform chat -Q -q <prompt>` per task, and publishes the lifecycle events with
the output as the `result` artifact. It is scaffolding with a planned demolition date:
when the dispatcher and worker adapter land, the bridge retires. Nothing here is
protocol - the wire contract is the payload spec's, unchanged.

## Where it runs

**Sidecar in the platform-agent pod, declared via the CR's `spec.deployment.sidecars`
field.** The bridge needs two things that only exist in that pod: the `hermes` CLI (it lives in the
platform-agent image, so the bridge image builds FROM it and adds one static binary) and
the persona state - `$HERMES_HOME` is the agent's data PVC, RWO, holding the platform
profile's config, memory, and skills. A separate Deployment would need that PVC mounted
cross-pod, which RWO only allows with same-node scheduling games. Not worth it for a
component we intend to delete.

The `sidecars` field takes ordinary `corev1.Container` entries, so the operator renders
the bridge without any operator code change and reconcile never fights us. The sidecar
mounts the same data volume, runs as the pod's KSA (model auth via Workload Identity for
free), and gets `NATS_URL` plus creds from the a2a creds Secret.

Concurrent hermes processes under one `$HERMES_HOME` is the kanban dispatcher's existing
posture (`deploy/docker/patches/kanban_result_required.py` documents `_default_spawn`
spawning the same kind of one-shot `hermes chat -q` process), so the bridge inherits a
known-working concurrency story. Cap is 2, matching the platform profile's `concurrency` in the profiles spec.

## What this deployment method costs

Two properties of riding `spec.deployment.sidecars`, stated here because the operator
cannot fix either one - gating a user-supplied container means overriding user intent.

**Flipping to `mode: today` with the sidecar still set takes the agent down.** The
operator copies `spec.deployment.sidecars` into the pod without consulting the mode, so
the flip removes the NATS Service and leaves the bridge dialling a host that no longer
resolves. Confirmed live 2026-09-05: the sidecar crash-loops, and because it shares the
agent's pod the pod never reaches Ready - the whole agent is down, not merely carrying
an A2A trace. Unset `spec.deployment.sidecars` _before_ flipping to `today`. In any
flip runbook that step is a blocker, not tidiness.

**The webhook does not screen sidecar env, on purpose.** The `SensitiveEnvVars`
refusal applies to `spec.deployment.env` only; a sidecar's own `env` is unscreened (the
webhook checks a sidecar's `securityContext`, and checks its `volumeMounts` against the
reserved volume names, and nothing else about it). The bridge depends on exactly that
gap - its `NATS_URL` and credentials arrive as sidecar env.
Closing it breaks this deployment method, so it stays open as a stated trade while the
bridge exists; the bridge's demolition removes the reason.

One provenance note: the bridge image is release surface. `a2a/Dockerfile.hermes-bridge`
builds it (`FROM` the platform-agent image plus the one static binary above), the release
workflow publishes it as `hermes-bridge` beside the other first-party images, `FROM` the
platform-agent image the same run pushed under the same commit tag, and `images.json`
carries it with no operator override, since the operator renders no bridge and the
sidecar's image is the CR's. `deploy/docker/cloudbuild-ci.yaml` builds the presubmit's own
in its `a2a-bridge` step when `hack/ci-deploy.sh` runs under `EVAL_MODE_NEXT=1`, `FROM` the
platform-agent image that same build produced, by the tag it just pushed and never from a
registry default; the deploy then declares it on the CR for the eval install
(`docs/designs/eval-next-transport.md`, "The CI flag"). Either way the sidecar and the agent
container it shares a pod with are one build. The static `bridge` bus user the next section
describes is the released mechanism, not scaffolding graduation removes: the password arrives
as sidecar env from the operator's creds Secret, and it stays a password principal for the
reason given there.

## Bus user and grants

The `…in` subject has two reader roles by design - the dispatcher for new tasks, the
executor for everything after the submission. The bridge is both, collapsed into one
process: it holds the one durable consumer on `a2a.tasks.platform.*.in` (the dispatcher
role, `durable: bridge-platform`) and handles follow-ups and cancels for tasks it is
running (the executor role). That collapse is exactly what makes it a stand-in - when
the real dispatcher arrives, the roles separate again and the bridge has nothing left to
do.

The bridge connects as the static `bridge` user, whose grants are written for this
program and nothing else: subscribe `a2a.tasks.platform.*.in`, publish
`a2a.tasks.platform.*.events`, `$KV.runtime-state.>` both ways for the in-flight
registry below, and `_INBOX.bridge.>`. Nothing wider - a bridge that can publish
submissions is a bridge that can impersonate the gateway.

The JetStream tax is not `$JS.API.>`: it is the `$JS.API` subjects the bridge emits on
TASKS and `KV_runtime-state` — stream info, consumer create, pull, direct get, and the
KV watcher's consumer delete — named one by one in the operator's
`a2aBridgeJetStreamGrants`; plus `$JS.ACK.TASKS.>`, ack scoped to the one stream this
user consumes with explicit ack (unscoped `$JS.ACK.>` is a cross-principal +TERM), and
`$JS.FC.>`. Reads go through `DIRECT.GET` and not `STREAM.MSG.GET`; the provision script
sets `--allow-direct` on every stream so nats.go picks that route, and only that route
is granted.

Note which delete is in that list and which is not: `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE` is granted
for `KV_runtime-state`, for the watcher, and withheld for TASKS. The bridge calls
`lib.TasksGet` on every task it dispatches and `lib.TaskInReplay` on a task a worker is about
to spawn whose `…in` subject's newest message is neither the submission nor a cancel (the
cancel look-ahead below; the newest-message read itself is a direct get and opens nothing),
and a call that finds messages creates an ordered consumer on TASKS; nothing deletes it. It is reaped by the five-second inactive threshold
both reads set on it, which is why the replay costs a consumer slot for the calls of the last
five seconds rather than for the last five minutes of them (gke-labs/kube-agents#1739) without
the bridge needing a destructive verb on TASKS. The slot outlives the call it served: the
threshold runs from the call returning, not from it starting. A call on a task the retention window no longer holds
creates no consumer at all -- the horizon read finds nothing before the consumer is
created. Either way the call emits no refused publish of its own. One does arrive if the
ordered consumer resets mid-replay -- a bus reconnect is enough -- because nats.go deletes
the consumer it replaces: that publish on `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.TASKS.<name>` is refused,
which costs a log line and leaves the consumer it could not delete to the same threshold.
It is the one violation this grant produces by design, so any other `Permissions Violation`
in the bridge's log still means what it says.

**Static is the answer here, not a residue.** `bridge` replaced the shared `worker` user
rather than inheriting it, and it stays a password principal on purpose. The auth
callout keys its map on the username TokenReview returns, which names a ServiceAccount;
a sidecar shares its pod's ServiceAccount, so a projected token would resolve the bridge
to the same map entry as the `agent` principal in the container beside it and hand each
of them the union of the two grant sets — which is the `worker` user rebuilt under a new
name. The callout cannot see which container opened a connection, and `Narrowing` is
pod-scoped, so no map shape available today separates them. The bridge gets a token when
it stops sharing a pod with the agent, which is the same event that retires it.

What the split bought, measured from this side: the bridge holds no grant on
`TOPICS-STATE` or `TOPICS-JOURNAL` at all — not the reads and not the writes. The
blackboard belongs to the `a2a` CLI in the agent container, which is now its own callout
principal. `TestBridgeJetStreamGrantOnARealServer`'s refused table is where that is
measured.

### Migrating an existing sidecar

An install whose `spec.deployment.sidecars` entry still names the retired user fails
closed rather than quietly: `worker` is gone from the rendered `nats.conf`, so the
sidecar's connect is refused at authentication and the container crash-loops. Because it
shares the agent's pod, the pod does not reach Ready — the same failure shape the
`mode: today` flip produces above. Two edits, both in the sidecar's own `env`:
`NATS_USER` becomes `bridge`, and `NATS_PASSWORD`'s `secretKeyRef.key` becomes
`bridge-password`. The Secret is the same `<agent>-a2a-nats-creds`; the operator fills the
new key on the next reconcile. It does not remove the old one: `ensureA2ACredsSecret` only
fills keys that are missing or empty and never prunes, so `worker-password` stays in the
Secret of an upgraded install indefinitely. It is dead data rather than a live credential —
`worker` is no longer a user in the rendered `nats.conf`, so presenting that password
authenticates to nothing — but the key's presence is not evidence the sidecar has been
migrated, and a reader checking whether an install has taken the split should read
`nats.conf` or the sidecar's `env`, not the Secret's key set.

Both edits are in `env`, and that is the supported route on purpose. A `sidecarVolumes`
entry that mounts `<agent>-a2a-nats-creds` — or the `<agent>-a2a-nats-config` or
`<agent>-a2a-callout-keys` Secret, or a projection of the `a2a-bus` audience under any
name — is refused at admission, and stripped from the render on an install running the
A2A surface, because a volume hands a second container far more than the `bridge`
principal's one password. `<agent>-a2a-nats-creds` and the `nats.conf` in
`<agent>-a2a-nats-config` both carry `sys-password`, which is the `$SYS` account, and
`<agent>-a2a-callout-keys` holds the issuer seed the auth callout signs with. The
agent's own credential is in none of them: under the callout the `agent` principal has
no shared secret at all, and the `a2a-bus` audience projection is the only route to it
as a credential. The seed is a way to mint one, which is the other reason that Secret is
not something to hand a sidecar.

A third edit is owed only by an install that overrode `BRIDGE_PROFILE`, and its failure
lands in an unhelpful place. The retired `worker` user's subscribe grant was
`a2a.tasks.*.*.in` — the addressee position was a wildcard, so pointing the bridge at
another addressee just worked. `bridge`'s grants name `platform` literally
(`a2aBridgeAddressee`, which is also `defaultProfile` in the bridge's own `main.go`: one
value living in two modules that cannot import each other). Override the env now and the
intake half still works — the consumer is created and pulled over `$JS.API`, where the
filter subject rides in the request body and no subject grant sees it — so the other
addressee's task is delivered. It stops there. `accept` publishes `submitted` on
`a2a.tasks.<other>.*.events` before it puts anything on the worker queue, and that subject
is not in the publish list, so the publish is refused, the submission is dropped, and
Hermes is never spawned. The refusal does not read as one: a rejected JetStream publish is
a reply that never arrives, so the bridge logs a timeout and the submitter waits on a task
that got no terminal event and was never run. Leave the env unset, or widen the grant in
the operator to match — the two have to move together.

The agent container is the other half of the same change and needs no edit: the operator
stops rendering `NATS_USER`/`NATS_PASSWORD` there and mounts a projected token instead.
One user-visible consequence — topic entries the `a2a` CLI writes now carry
`from.session` of `agent` rather than `worker`, so a query matching on the old value
returns nothing for entries written after the upgrade.

## Lifecycle, steering, cancel

Per task: `submitted` on accept (before the consumer ack, so a bridge death before the
ack just redelivers), `working` when the subprocess spawns, the stdout as a `result`
artifact (chunked if large), one terminal `status-update` with `final: true`. A nonzero
exit is terminal `failed` with the evidence in the status message: `reason: hermes-exited-nonzero -
exit status N; session: <id>; stdout tail: …; stderr tail: …`. Both tails are bounded (2 KiB each),
and `session:` carries the id when `hermes chat -Q` printed its `session_id:` line on stderr (it
is the last thing the CLI writes before exiting), so the transcript under the profile's session
store can be found from the terminal alone. Exit 75 is Hermes's `EX_TEMPFAIL` for a turn that
gave up on the provider's rate limit or billing; it is named `reason: hermes-rate-limited` instead,
which the eval harness classes as infrastructure rather than the persona's failure (the image patch
`apply_quiet_rate_limit_exit.py` makes a plain `-Q` run exit 75 on that failure, as a kanban worker
already did). A
submission with no text parts is terminal `rejected`. New-task detection is the
dispatcher's rule, and 9/9 widened it: BOTH event subjects empty means new, not `…events`
alone (profiles spec). The bridge satisfies that without a change of its own, because it
asks `lib.TasksGet` rather than reading a subject - and `tasks/get` folds `…events` and
`…supervisor` together, so a platform task carrying a supervisor terminal and nothing on
`…events` comes back `final` and is acked with a warning, not run again. That matters here
because the gateway's supervisor grant is an addressee wildcard, so such a task is
constructible. The component that does NOT get this for free is the worker adapter, whose
`priorEvents` deliberately replaced `lib.TasksGet` with a consumer on its own `…events`
(a session's grants reach neither `STREAM.INFO` nor a get-by-subject) and so cannot see a
terminal its own predecessor's supervisor declared. Anything on `…in` for a task with a
terminal event is acked with a warning and nothing else.

**Steering:** `hermes chat -Q -q` is one-shot - there is no stdin to inject into. A
follow-up message to a running task is acked and answered with a non-final status
echoing the task's current state (`working` once the subprocess spawned, `submitted`
while still queued) whose message says the input cannot be absorbed mid-run and cancel
is available.
Honest, never silent. This does not change task state (payload spec assertion 12).

**Cancel:** SIGTERM to the subprocess's process group, SIGKILL after a grace period,
then terminal `canceled` (`reason: canceled-by-request`). A task racing to completion may
land `completed` first - both orders are legal and the terminal event wins. A per-task
deadline (default 7200s, matching the profile's `activeDeadlineSeconds`) takes the same
kill path and lands `failed`.

A cancel for a task still queued finalizes it `canceled` with `reason: canceled-before-start`
and nothing is spawned, and the worker looks for one itself before it spawns. The durable
delivers serially and acks after the handler, so a cancel already on the task's `…in`
subject when the bridge binds - the eval harness abandoning a submission nobody took, or any
cancel inside the stream's retention window - is dispatched only after the submission's
accept returns, and by then an idle worker, which a freshly bound bridge has, holds the run.
Between dequeue and spawn the worker therefore reads the task's `…in` subject for a `cancel`
newer than the submission it holds and, finding one, finalizes `canceled-before-start` and
spawns nothing. The read is the subject's newest message by direct get (`lib.LastEnvelope`,
no consumer): a `cancel` there is newer than the submission, and the submission there means
nothing followed it; only a subject whose newest message is something else, a follow-up
behind a cancel, is replayed in full (`lib.TaskInReplay`, the one-subject form of the read
`tasks/get` does on the event subjects, on the same five-second ephemeral). That is what
keeps a bind over a backlog of abandoned submissions from opening a consumer per task at bus
speed, and the replay that remains is paced: at most `BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` of them are in hand
at once, each held until its ephemeral's five-second threshold has run after it returned, so the
look-ahead holds that many live consumer slots at most, plus whatever the server has not yet
reaped at the window's edge. The operator's reserve counts twice the default
`BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` of 2 (its tail factor), since the operator leaves the variable unset; a
bridge started with a higher value, as the eval's sidecar is, can hold more look-ahead consumers
than the reserve counts. Twice `BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` is the bound the bridge's own test holds the
stream to. A run the durable's cancel has already
ended takes no slot at all. `working` is published only after that read, so a cancelled
run never shows it. It is
a read, not a consume: the durable still delivers the cancel to the handler afterwards, and
it does nothing - the run is normally gone from the bridge's table by then, so the cancel
takes the orphan path, which reads the newest event the same consumer-free way, finds the
terminal and acks with a warning like any other in-traffic for a finished task; in the window
before finalize drops the run it finds it final and returns, finalize being idempotent. A read
that fails, a bus error or its 10s bound, is logged and the run spawns
anyway; the cancel still arrives on the durable and kills it, the bound the bridge always
had, where a read failure that dropped the task would leave it open with no terminal event.

## Sizing against the eval harness

This section is the canonical statement of the sizing; the eval transport design
([`eval-next-transport.md`](../../docs/designs/eval-next-transport.md), stage 1) summarises it.
An eval install that declares the bridge sidecar runs it against the presubmit's fan-out, and
two numbers bound what it can take. `BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` (default 2, the cap above) is the worker
count: a task past it is accepted and `submitted` and then queued with no subprocess until a
worker frees, and the harness classifies a repetition that reaches its budget still
`submitted` as infrastructure rather than a graded case - it cancels the task and the bridge
answers `canceled-before-start`. The presubmit fans units out at `EVAL_TASK_PARALLELISM`,
default 4, the nightly at 8, so the sidecar declares `BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` at or above that
value; at the defaults two of every four concurrent units wait for as long as the two ahead of
them run. The queue behind the workers is fixed at `taskQueueCapacity`, 1024 in `bridge.go`,
and a submission past it is finalized `failed` with `reason: bridge-queue-overflow`, also
infrastructure in the harness's classification. Size the parallelism against both: concurrency
at or above the parallelism, and the number of submissions a run can have outstanding at once,
the units in flight plus anything abandoned and not yet cancelled, well under the queue
capacity. `hack/ci-deploy.sh` declares that sidecar under `EVAL_MODE_NEXT=1` and sets
`BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` to the run's `EVAL_TASK_PARALLELISM`.

## Supervision

The bridge finalizes its own orphans, which is not the same as being their supervisor.
The ratified split says every task's supervisor is the component that spawned its
execution; the bridge spawned its own execution, so there is no separate supervisor to
be - and no supervisor WRITE either.

**It is not a supervisor principal, and 9/9's subject split does not move it.** The
gateway spawns session pods and finalizes tasks it did not execute, so it publishes on
`…supervisor`, a subject no executor reaches. The bridge is the executor. When it
finalizes an orphan it is finishing its OWN task across a restart, as itself, so its
terminal stays on `…events` where every other event it writes goes, and its `from`
agrees with that subject like any executor's. Profile-addressed tasks have no
supervisor ROLE until the dispatcher lands - though the gateway's rendered grant is an
addressee wildcard and reaches their `…supervisor` regardless, which the profiles spec
spells out; that is a gap the profiles
spec names, not one this sweep fills. Two failure classes:

- **The subprocess dies under a live bridge.** The runner sees the exit and publishes
  terminal `failed` with the evidence. Ordinary executor path, nothing special.
- **The bridge dies mid-task.** The submission was already acked, so nobody redelivers
  it, and no terminal event exists. The bridge keeps an in-flight registry in the
  `runtime-state` KV bucket (key per accepted taskId, written before `submitted`,
  deleted after the terminal publish). On startup, before consuming, it sweeps: fold
  each registered task's events, and for any non-final one publish terminal `failed`
  (`reason: bridge-died-without-terminal-event`).

The sweep's publish is a compare-and-swap per the profiles spec, not a read-then-write:
expected-last-subject-sequence pinned to the last event the fold saw. A dying
subprocess's flush racing the sweep wins cleanly, the CAS is rejected, and the sweep
re-reads instead of double-finalizing. Whichever writer loses lands in the
warn-and-drop path like any other post-final event.

That still holds here after 9/9, and it is worth saying why, because the profiles spec
records that the same CAS stopped protecting the dispatcher's janitor on that date.
Expected-last-subject-sequence is per subject. The janitor's terminal moved to
`…supervisor` while the executor kept writing `…events`, so the two writers stopped
sharing the subject the CAS is evaluated on. The bridge's sweep reads and writes the
same `…events` subject as the runner it is racing, so the racing write still
invalidates the expectation and the server still refuses the loser.

The sweep assumes incarnations are serial. That assumption is real on this install -
the kubelet restarts the sidecar container in place, and the operator renders the agent
Deployment with strategy `Recreate`, so two bridges never run at once. It is an
assumption, not a mechanism, and it has a named boundary: `Recreate` is the render's
default only while replicas is 1 - `spec.deployment.availability.replicas` above 1
switches the strategy to RollingUpdate (`resolveDeploymentReplicasAndStrategy`,
`manifest_helpers.go`), and an overlapping incarnation could then sweep-fail a task
its predecessor is still running. Real executor fencing belongs to the stage-3
dispatcher, not to scaffolding with a demolition date.

Honest gaps, accepted for the playground: no queue-staleness guard (the lib's subscribe
path doesn't expose server ingest timestamps, and `queueTimeoutSeconds` is the
dispatcher's job when it exists), no heartbeats on `agents.hb.>`, a submission whose
events lookup keeps failing is dropped with a log line rather than redelivered (a new
submission's lookup is answered by the direct horizon gets and opens no consumer, so it gets
one quick retry for a bus hiccup; an orphan cancel's lookup opens the consumer and can be
refused at the TASKS cap, so a failure from before the consumer existed is retried over six
seconds, past the inactive threshold the refusal clears on, and a failure from after it is not,
since that consumer is live and another attempt would open another; the lib acks
unconditionally after the handler, so a lookup a shutdown interrupts is also dropped, and a nak
path is a lib delta if a persistent failure ever bites),
and a terminal publish that fails outright - a bus outage outlasting the finalize
budget at exactly that moment - leaves the task in the registry for the NEXT
incarnation's sweep, which may be far away on a healthy sidecar; until then the bridge
holds the task as done while the stream shows no terminal event, and a later cancel
cannot unstick it.
All retire with the bridge. One more: zombie reaping. The operator deliberately leaves
`ShareProcessNamespace` unset (`platformagent_manifests.go`, the pod-template comment)
so no container hands its `/proc/<pid>/environ` to its neighbours. The bridge binary is
therefore PID 1 of its own container, orphans escaping the group kill reparent to it,
and Go's `cmd.Wait` reaps only direct children - zombies can accumulate until the
container restarts. Accepted for the playground with the rest; the stage-3 dispatcher
runs executions as Jobs, where the problem does not exist.

## Definition of done

A task published to `a2a.tasks.platform.<id>.in` on the W6 install returns the platform
agent's real answer as a `result` artifact. Cancel works. The event sequence passes
the lifecycle conformance assertions (9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18), table-driven like the
`a2a/lib` conformance suite. Two of those changed meaning on 9/9 without changing number:
9 gained the supervisor-only-terminal exception and 10 now spans both event subjects, and
the bridge's own tests still assert the single-subject form. They pass because a
platform task has no supervisor writing to it in practice, not because they cover the
new wording - so do not read a green bridge suite as coverage of the split.
