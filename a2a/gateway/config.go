	// InjectListen is the inject side door's HTTP listen address, and setting

	A2ADoorListen string

	// A2ADoorToken is the bearer token the door requires on every RPC

	// A2ADoorPublicURL is the URL the agent card advertises for the door's

	// MetricsPort is the metrics-only listener's port (A2A_METRICS_PORT);
	// zero means no listener. It binds every interface, because its caller

	// MetricsPath and nothing else. It may not be either door's port: a door
	// that lost its port to this listener would fail to bind, and a door
	// that won it would be what the collector's NetworkPolicy rule admits.

	// DisplayMode is the existing Chat integration's default-vs-debug split
	// (GoogleChatSpec.Mode), honoured by this relay rather than reinvented:
	// under "default" the rolling line carries the state but never the

	DefaultAddressee string

	// SpawnSessions arms the session-pod path (spawn/rehydrate/sweep with
	// client-go). The gateway pod now always mounts a service-account token
	// (it needs one to create pods at all), so this is a rollout switch
	// rather than a capability one: off, the gateway routes every task to
	// DefaultAddressee and creates nothing. The k8s client is still built
	// lazily so that an install with it off never depends on the RBAC.
	SpawnSessions bool

	// IdleTTL is the reap threshold since the session's last activity: a

	IdleTTL time.Duration

	// AttributionSalt keys the HMAC pseudonyms in authority blocks. The
	// salt is SESSION_KV_SALT, the one the install already provisions into
	// platform-agent-secrets (settled 8/31, spec-chatops-gateway.md): the
	// shipped attribution path hashes session metadata with it, so hashing
	// with anything else silently breaks the cross-surface audit join this
	// pseudonym exists to preserve — one human, one value, on the bus and
	// in session metadata. The env-var fallbacks below are playground
	// posture for installs without that Secret, and the derived one
	// (HKDF-SHA-256 over the bus password) is a recorded deviation on two
	// counts: the broken join, and a de-anonymization key handed to whoever
	// holds the bus password. HKDF is the construction a credential is
	// permitted to pass through, and that is all it is: it answers neither
	// count, and it is not a password hash — no work factor, so it does not
	// make a weak hand-set NATS_PASSWORD any harder to guess from a leaked
	// salt. Provisioning the Secret is what fixes that.
	AttributionSalt []byte

	// TaskDeadline mirrors the worker adapter's task deadline — the SAME
	// env the adapter reads (A2A_TASK_DEADLINE_SECONDS, integer seconds),
	// because the spawner renders it onto the worker pod alongside the
	// pod-level activeDeadlineSeconds it sizes above it, and two knobs for
	// one contract would drift. Unset means 1800s, the adapter's own
	// default. The adapter kills the harness and publishes the terminal at
	// this deadline; the pod deadline (this plus a fixed grace) is the
	// backstop that hands a wedged ADAPTER to Sweep instead of letting it
	// hold its bus credential indefinitely. Raising it buys longer tasks at
	// the price of how long a wedged worker can hold a cap slot; lowering
	// it turns long-running asks into failed tasks sooner.
	TaskDeadline time.Duration

	// AskTTL bounds the copies of a turn that session-state keeps past the
	// bus (A2A_ASK_TTL): the active task's `ask` copy, and each task history
	// entry's requester (backend and pseudonymized subject) and attribution,
	// aged by the entry's StartedAt. The ask copy's stated justification —
	// the same text rides the W-bounded stream and the copy dies at the
	// terminal event — holds only where a terminal event is guaranteed, and
	// the spec names the case where it is not (a wedged adapter, until every
	// pod carries its deadline; fixed-route executors have no janitor until
	// stage 3). So the record gets an independent bound: the reap scan
	// clears an ask, and a history entry's requester and attribution, once
	// they are this old (exactly this old included), leaving the task record
	// and the history entry themselves intact. Unset means 24h — far above
	// any legitimate task's runtime, well under the stream's 72h retention,
	// so the KV copies always have the shorter horizon the content posture
	// claims. Raising it toward the stream retention erodes exactly that
	// claim; lowering it trims how long a status card can echo the ask, and
	// how long after a turn a child task can still be minted on its behalf:
	// past the TTL the entry has no requester to check, so a delegation from
	// it is refused.
	AskTTL time.Duration

	// SessionTTL bounds the lifetime of idle session records in session-state
	// (A2A_SESSION_TTL). The session record holds contextId across pod
	// incarnations. Once a session has no active pod and has seen no activity
	// for longer than SessionTTL, its record is deleted from KV (leaving a
	// ~100-byte tombstone marker under the bucket's --history=1 limit),
	// bounding session-state growth to a marker per conversation rather than
	// accumulating multi-KB session records, rosters, and task histories
	// (including sessions with stale or abandoned active tasks whose executors
	// never completed, while preserving tasks actively running within
	// TaskDeadline). Unset means 7 days (168h), sitting comfortably past
	// TASKS' 72h retention horizon.
	SessionTTL time.Duration

	// FirstEventGrace bounds how long an active task with NOTHING on its
	// events subject may hold a conversation's serialization
	// (A2A_FIRST_EVENT_GRACE). Every other bound assumes a pod: the adapter's
	// deadline runs from task start inside the worker, the pod deadline from
	// pod start, and Sweep watches pod phases — so a task whose executor
	// never came up (a spawn that never happened, a bus that dropped between
	// the two publishes, a gateway restart mid-turn) has no events for the
	// heal in handleInbound to see a terminal in, and the record steers every
	// later message into it. Past this grace the heal treats "no events" as
	// "never started" and releases the serialization; it publishes no
	// terminal for the task, because age alone is not evidence. Unset
	// means 10 minutes: the spec's cold start is 5-10s and the pod deadline's
	// pre-start budget (podDeadlineGrace, the image pull before the process
	// starts) is 10 minutes, so a task still legitimately pre-first-event at
	// this age is a pod that will not be coming up. Lowering it risks
	// releasing a slow-starting worker's task out from under it — the next
	// turn then starts a second task while the first may still emit;
	// raising it is how long a user waits before the conversation answers
	// again. Values under 1m are refused at boot.
	FirstEventGrace time.Duration

	// OwnerDeployment names the gateway's own Deployment
	// (A2A_OWNER_DEPLOYMENT; the operator renders its own render's name).
	// When set, every spawned session pod carries an ownerReference to it,
	// so Kubernetes GC reaps sessions when the Deployment goes — cleanupA2A

	// SessionServiceAccount is the ServiceAccount every session pod runs
	// as, rendered by the operator as <agent>-a2a-session and passed here
	// so the two cannot disagree. It carries no RBAC; its only purpose is
	// to be the identity the kubelet mints the pod-bound bus token against,
	// and the identity the callout's map is keyed on.
	//
	// There is no default. A wrong or absent name spawns pods whose token
	// the callout has no entry for, which fails as every session refused at
	// connect — a boot-time refusal here is the same information, hours

	// concurrent delegations at that per-pod price plus model-quota
	// contention; lowering it turns busy-hour delegations into refusals
	// sooner - a UX decision, not a safety one, because this cap is the
	// usability half. The enforcement half is the namespace ResourceQuota
