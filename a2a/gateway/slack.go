// isSessionThread reports whether a thread carries every message: from the

// which is the source of truth for the threads the gateway has started a
// task in. The lookup runs on the event pump's goroutine, under
// slackSessionLookupTimeout as well as ctx. A failure — the timeout
// included — reports false without caching: dropping is safe (the user can
// @mention), and the next reply asks again. With no lookup wired (an
// embedder that offers none) a miss is a false; there is nothing to ask.
//
// Nothing is derived from the root message, and that is deliberate. The
// root can say that someone mentioned the bot; it cannot say that the
// gateway verified them and started a task, and only the latter makes a
// session thread. So a channel ask's own thread becomes a session thread
// when the gateway starts the task there — TaskStarted, the same as any
// other thread — and a channel mention from a sender the principal map
// refuses roots nothing.
//
// Nor is a session thread one forever. It stays one while its session is
// active or has been active within the idle TTL, and past that it needs a
// fresh mention. A cached true carries the moment it expires
// (sessionExpiresAt), and from then on the entry is treated as expired: the
// registry is asked again, and its answer -- true when a task is running
// there or the session has had a turn inside the TTL, false otherwise --
// overwrites the entry whichever way it goes. That is the one path a true
// is downgraded on, and it is deliberate: the registry's false here is not
// a stale read racing a TaskStarted, it is the gateway's word that the
// session went idle. A positive answer carries the registry's own bound
// (SessionLookup's until: the last activity plus the TTL, or a TTL from
// now for a task still running), and the entry expires on THAT, not on a
// TTL from the adapter's clock -- the message that made it ask may be one
// the gateway refused, which moves no activity, and a cache stamped from
// its own clock would then hold a true the registry had already withdrawn.
// So the cache and the source agree to the instant; the session record
// itself is not the bound, since it outlives the reap, and nothing here
// reads it as one. A thread the registry still holds is asked about once
// per bound, not once per reply. A lookup that fails on an expired entry
// leaves it as it was, reports false and does not cache, like a failed
// miss.
//
// A false cached here is not permanent, and must not be. TaskStarted for the
// same thread calls markSessionThread(key, true), which overwrites it, so a
// thread that becomes a session mid-conversation stops dropping its
// unmentioned messages from that task on. Without the overwrite the negative
// entry would outlive — and silence — the very session it was cached before.
// The reverse overwrite is refused for a true that has not expired
// (markSessionThread never downgrades).
//
// One stated limit: an unmentioned reply that reaches the pump after the
// ask that starts the task was enqueued but before its worker's TaskStarted
// finds no task in the registry, and is discarded. That window is about one
// Slack round trip (the worker's Roster read), it costs that one message and
