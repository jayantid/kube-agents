	// way, with a plain line instead of a status card (there is no status
	// to replay). Only TaskNotFound qualifies: a transport failure cannot
	// rule out events, so it heals nothing, as everywhere else the
	// supervisor paths consult the stream. No terminal is published here:
	// age alone is not evidence, a first event that is merely late could
	// still arrive, and no supervisor path ever sees a task with no pod —
	// so a task released here ages out with the stream's retention, the

// trustworthy. A pure read, as SessionLookup requires -- no lock, no heal,
// no post, no publish, no write.
//
// A record alone is not the answer. mintSession creates one for ANY verified
// turn before the text is dispatched, so a mapped user's "@bot stop" with
// nothing running, or an ask refused at the session cap, leaves a record
// behind and starts nothing; answering true on that would adopt the thread
// the way TaskStarted never did, and the two sources would disagree. A
// started task is what startTask writes -- ActiveTask while it runs, and a
// TaskRef in Tasks for the record's life -- so that is what this reads.
//
// Nor is a record with a past task the answer forever. A running task keeps
// the conversation a session however long it runs (reapOnce never touches a
// pod under one, and a thread whose task is still working must carry the
// "stop"). Running is the reap's own predicate -- an ActiveTask that is not
// Detached -- so this read and the reap share one definition of it: a task
// the user has stopped, whose terminal never arrived (cancelTask sets
// Detached and leaves ActiveTask in place), is not running here any more
// than it exempts the pod there. Otherwise the conversation is a session
// only while it has had activity within the idle TTL: LastTaskActivity is
// written by routeTurn on every turn and persisted, and the TTL is the same
// g.cfg.IdleTTL reapOnce reads. The record itself is not the bound --
// reapOnce deletes the pod and keeps the record, Tasks and all, and nothing
// else deletes it -- so a read keyed on the record's existence would answer
// true for any thread a task ever started in, for good. Activity is the
// bound; the record merely carries it.
//
// The until returned with a true is the registry's own bound, not the
// adapter's: for the idle case it is LastTaskActivity + IdleTTL, the instant the
// registry itself would start answering false, so a cache that expires on
// it cannot outlive the answer it was given (a message the gateway refuses,
// an unmapped sender's, moves nothing, and a cache stamped from its own
// clock would hold a true the registry had already withdrawn). For a
// running task there is no bound to hand over, so it is now + IdleTTL: the
