// The authority block is the request-level field the gateway populates at
// ingress: who asked, verified how, in front of whom, and what this request is
// permitted to do.
//
// `requester` and `audience` are ADVISORY and stay that way. Nothing stops
// another bus client from inventing them, so consumers MUST NOT authorize on
// them; they are the audit trail.
//
// `grants` is not advisory, and it is not a claim either. It carries a
// reference — a key in the `cap` bucket and the revision the write returned —
// and the capability it names was written on a subject only the gateway may
// publish to. A consumer does not read the entry (no broker may) and does not
// trust the block: it hands the reference to the verifier, which reads the
// chain and answers whether a verb is permitted. Inventing a reference gets an
// attacker a key the gateway never wrote, or one whose delegate is somebody
// else; both are refused. See docs/architecture/09-capability-envelope.md.
