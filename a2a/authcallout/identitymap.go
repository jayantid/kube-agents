// Package authcallout implements the NATS auth callout service the deployment
// spec specifies: it validates a client's Kubernetes ServiceAccount token
// against the cluster and answers with the account and permission set that
// identity is mapped to.
//
// The property it exists to preserve is the deployment spec's, unchanged: the
// bus decides who may say what before a message is read. What changes is where
// the permission set comes from. Statically rendered users put one password per
// role in a Secret, so every workload sharing a role shares a credential and
// the grant list can only be as fine as the roles someone thought to write. The
// callout resolves an identity the cluster already issues and vouches for, so
// the grant list can be as fine as the identities are.
//
// The agents never read the map. The constrained party does not see its own
// ceiling; it just hits it.
