// Reserved principal names: the users a narrowed pod may not be named after.
//
// A narrowed user is named for its pod, and that name is also its inbox
// prefix: sessionGrants hands it `_INBOX.<pod>.>` on both sides. A pod named
// after another principal would therefore be granted that principal's inbox,
// and could read the JetStream replies delivered there or publish forged ones
// into it. The gateway mints session pod names that never collide with a
// principal; a pod someone created by hand under a narrowed ServiceAccount can
// be named anything.
//
// Three kinds of name are reserved, and one check covers all of them:
//
//   - The static users nats.conf authenticates by password (gateway, bridge,
//     seed, web, console, sys, and the callout's own user). They are in no
//     identity map, so the callout cannot learn them from the map it serves.
//     The operator renders them into the callout's environment instead, from
//     the same list it renders nats.conf's auth_users from, as a
//     comma-separated list. The callout does not read nats.conf: that file
//     carries every static user's password, and the callout has no reason to
//     hold any of them.
//   - The identity map's own users (provision, agent, verifier, session, and
//     whatever else the map holds). authorize mints each entry that is not
//     narrowed under its `user`, and that entry's grants carry
//     `_INBOX.<user>.>`, so these are the names whose inboxes a same-named pod
//     would share. The narrowed entry's own user (session) is never minted,
//     since its connections are renamed to their pods; it is reserved with the
//     rest, harmlessly, because one check covers every map user. They are
//     read from the map being served, built when the map is parsed (see
//     IdentityMap.users), so a reload that adds or removes a user moves the
//     reserved set in the same pointer swap that moves the map. A removed
//     user's name is released at once, but the swap revokes nothing:
//     connections the removed principal already holds keep its inbox until
//     their user JWT expires, at most GrantTTL (defaultGrantTTL, one hour,
//     since the operator does not set A2A_GRANT_TTL_SECONDS), and a narrowed
//     pod named after it can be minted the same inbox inside that window.
//     Only an operator re-render removes a map user; the window is accepted.
//   - The fixed-name addressees (the bridge's `platform`). A narrowed pod's
//     task subjects are keyed on its name, so a pod named after one would be
//     handed that addressee's subjects rather than an inbox. The operator
//     renders them separately, as A2A_RESERVED_ADDRESSEES; see addressees.go.
//
// A name in more than one is reported as a static principal first, then as an
// addressee, then as a map user. Neither overlap happens in a rendered config
// (the operator's contract test keeps the static residue out of the map, and
// no static user is named after an addressee), and the static wording is the
// one the refusal has always carried.

// not a single dot-free DNS-1123 label is an error, never a smaller set. A
// smaller set would admit a narrowed pod named after the dropped principal, and
// a parse that quietly skipped a malformed name would do exactly that.
//
// The label check is also what makes an exact comparison the right one. Pod
// names are DNS-1123 and so lowercase; a reserved name that is lowercase
// DNS-1123 too can be compared byte for byte, and a rendered name in any other
// case is refused here rather than silently never matching a pod.
// Identity.validate holds map users to the same label, so the comparison is
// exact for both halves: a dotted map user `a.b` would otherwise sit inside the
// inbox of a pod named `a` without matching it.
