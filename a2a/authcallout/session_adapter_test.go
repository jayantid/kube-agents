// what the adapter needs. That is an enumeration of what somebody believed the

// subprocess, actual named consumers, an actual terminal event — against a
// server that will refuse anything the enumeration got wrong. The two failure
// directions it catches are the ones a grant list cannot:
//
//   - a grant that is missing, which no negative test finds because nobody
//     thought to assert the thing the adapter quietly needs;
//   - a grant that is present but unusable, because the client library asks
//     for it in a shape the permission does not match. That is not
//     hypothetical here: ordered consumers were exactly this, granted in
//     spirit and unnameable in fact.
//
// It lives in this package rather than in worker-adapter because the harness
// is here: the real rendered nats.conf, the real map, the real callout. A
// second copy over there would be a second thing to keep in step.

// The same run again, this time down the path a gateway-spawned worker
// actually takes: the spawner names the submission's stream sequence and the
// adapter fetches exactly that message.
//
// This exists because the origin-sequence mechanism had never once been
// exercised under a session's real bus permissions. Everything that proved it
// works — the three tests in worker-adapter/adapter_origin_cap_test.go — runs
// against a bare nats-server with no auth_callout, no minted JWT and no
// grants, and calls fetchOrigin directly. That proves the logic. It cannot
// prove the one thing this package exists to prove, which is that the session
// credential admits the call at all, and the specific worry is sharp rather
// than vague: fetchOriginAtSeq asks for a consumer with
// DeliverPolicy=DeliverByStartSequence and OptStartSeq set, which is a
// different consumer config from anything a session had ever created before
// this change. If a session's grants refused that create — if the permission
// only admitted the DeliverAll shape the scan used — every gateway-spawned
// worker would hang for originFetchDeadline and then die, in production,
// while every test in the repository stayed green. That is exactly the class
// of "granted in spirit, unusable in fact" failure the test above this one was
// written for, and it is why the check belongs here, against the real
// rendered nats.conf and the real callout.
//
// Proving the PATH is the hard half, and it is deliberately overdetermined
// here, because a version of this test that passed equally well when the
// adapter quietly scanned would be worse than no test: it would read as
// coverage of a mechanism it never touched. That failure already happened once
// on this change. So:
//
//   - A decoy kind:message goes on the `…in` subject BEFORE the submission.
//     The scan takes the first kind:message on the subject, so a scanning
//     adapter runs the decoy; a sequence-fetching adapter runs the submission.
//     The two carry different correlation ids, and every event the adapter
//     publishes inherits the correlation id of whichever envelope it treated
//     as the origin — so the bus itself records which one it picked, and the
//     assertion is on bytes that were actually published rather than on
//     anything the test set up.
//
//   - The origin consumer's config is read back off the server afterwards.
//     The scan creates that consumer with DeliverAll and no start sequence;
//     this path creates it with DeliverByStartSequence at the named sequence.
//     The server's record of what it was asked for is the most direct evidence
//     available that the by-sequence create happened AND was permitted.
//
// The decoy-before-submission ordering is not a shape the gateway produces —
// it is the shape the subject is left in after the cap evicts the submission,
// staged here without the eviction so that the run can complete. What it
// stands for is real: past max_msgs_per_subject the head of the subject is a
// steer, and a scanning worker executes it as the request.

//
//   - a NATS permissions violation, which would mean the session's grants do
//     not admit a DeliverByStartSequence consumer create at all. That is not a
//     test gap, it is a production bug: every gateway-spawned worker would
