package hermesbridge

// The activity door: how the persona's tool calls become the task's
// `activity` artifact, and its heartbeat the `progress` artifact.
//
// Under -Q hermes writes nothing to stdout until the final response, so the
// bridge cannot learn about tool calls from the pipe it already holds. What
// hermes does offer is its outbound webhooks (agent/outbound_webhooks.py): a
// `hooks.outbound` config entry POSTs every pre_tool_call and post_tool_call
// to a URL, fire-and-forget through a bounded queue, signed with HMAC-SHA256
// when the variable named by `secret_env` is set. The bridge listens on a
// loopback address (the sidecar shares the pod's network namespace), and
// hands each child the entry through hermes's managed scope: a per-task
// directory holding the operator's managed config.yaml and .env with a
// hooks.outbound entry added, named by HERMES_MANAGED_DIR in the child's
// environment. Only the bridge's children carry the hook, so a kanban
// worker or cron tick under the same profile never POSTs anywhere, and a
// pod with no bridge has nothing to POST at.
//
// Correlation is the signature. Nothing in the delivery names the A2A task:
// hermes's own task_id is the kanban card or a fresh UUID, cwd and profile
// are shared by every process under the profile, and the URL does not expand
// environment variables. So each child gets a random key in its environment
// under ActivitySecretEnv, and a delivery belongs to whichever in-flight task's
// key verifies its signature - at most Concurrency keys to try. Only the
// bridge's children carry the hook (it rides each child's own managed
// scope), so a kanban worker or cron tick under the same profile never
// delivers; an unsigned or unmatched delivery that does arrive is answered
// 204 and dropped.
//
// Trust boundary, stated: everything in the pod is reachable from the
// persona's own terminal tool, its environment included. The trace is "as
// reported by the executor's process", the worker adapter's posture too; the
// key rejects cross-talk, not adversaries.
